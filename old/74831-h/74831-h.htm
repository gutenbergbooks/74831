<hr class="decor width3">

<p class="space-above2">The geological survey of the desert
surrounding the Fayûm was commenced in October 1898. At that time
the area, although so near to Cairo, was little known; the Rohlfs
Expedition maps marked the region as “unexplored,” and in fact with
the exception of a publication by Schweinfurth, who had traversed
the region from north to south, <em>via</em> Qasr el Sagha and Gar
el Gehannem to Rayan, there was little information obtainable. The
area being of considerable size (12,000 sq. kilom.) and almost
unexplored, both geologically and topographically, the primary
object was to construct as rapidly as possible a general map of the
depression, at the same time laying down in broad outline the chief
geological formations and trusting to future opportunity to examine
in more detail places of special interest.</p>

<p>Commencing work at Sêla, on the eastern side of the depression,
the survey was carried northwards along the east side of the
cultivated lands and thence through the northern desert, up to the
summit of the depression. After mapping westwards as far as the
isolated hill-mass of Gar el Gehannem the work was temporarily
suspended until, in the spring, the narrow defile of Wadi Muêla,
and the Wadi Rayan, forming the southern part of the Fayûm
depression, were provisionally examined.</p>

<p>In January 1901, samples of soil and water from the cultivated
lands were collected as an experimental soil-survey, and the
results have been published.<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>During the winter’s work of 1902-03 a traverse was carried from
Gar el Gehannem in a south-west direction through a hitherto
unexplored part of the depression. On reaching a point midway
between Cairo and the oasis of Baharia a connection was made
eastwards to Wadi Rayan. In the winter of 1903-04 further
exploration was carried out in the neighbourhood of Gar el
Gehannem.</p>

<p>It will be convenient here to briefly relate the history of the
discovery of the remarkable series of new and extinct animal forms,
the recovery of which from the Fayûm deposits has created such
widespread interest in the zoological world. When Schweinfurth
crossed the region in 1879 he obtained fossil bones, which were
examined and determined by Dames to be the remains of cetacea of
the genus <i>Zeuglodon</i>, from certain beds of the escarpment
west of Qasr el Sagha; these, it is believed, were the earliest
vertebrate remains obtained from the Fayûm. During the early part
of the survey of the district, remains of fish and crocodiles were
frequently found in one of the beds of the Middle Eocene, probably
on the same horizon as that from which Schweinfurth had collected.
Fragments of bone were also commonly met with on a much higher
horizon (<em>i.e.</em>, near the base of the Fluvio-marine series)
but nothing of particular interest was obtained, as no detailed
search could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> be made
at that time. In April 1901, during the survey of the western end
of the Birket el Qurûn, some of the localities found to be
bone-bearing in 1898 were re-visited in company with Dr. C. W.
Andrews, who was in Egypt at the time and had accompanied the
survey in order to obtain specimens of jackals, hares, etc., for
the British Museum, in connection with the forthcoming work on
Egyptian mammals. In one of these Dr. Andrews picked up several
vertebrae which turned out to belong to a new species of
<i>Pterosphenus</i>.</p>

<p>Further north, when descending the Middle Eocene escarpments at
a place not previously examined, we crossed the outcrop of the
bone-beds at a point where a considerable number of mammalian and
reptilian bones lay exposed on the surface, many in an excellent
state of preservation. The importance of the find was evident, and
a short examination of the material on the spot enabled Dr. Andrews
to pronounce the discovery to be of the highest importance from a
palaeontological point of view.</p>

<p>Some three weeks’ work in the immediate neighbourhood resulted
in a very good collection of vertebrates from the Middle Eocene
beds, including several new genera afterwards described<a id=
"FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
under the names of <i>Eosiren</i>, <i>Barytherium</i>,
<i>Mœritherium</i>, <i>Gigantophis</i>, etc. Moreover, a fossil
tooth brought in by one of the camelmen from a point several
kilometres to the north led to a careful examination of the lower
beds of the overlying Upper Eocene formation, which resulted in
obtaining well-preserved remains belonging to a new genus, since
described as <i>Palaeomastodon</i>. All the material so far
obtained was taken home to be worked up and determined at the
British Museum and a preliminary description was published by Dr.
Andrews in the Geological Magazine.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1901-02 the survey of the Fayûm was resumed
with the special intention of following up the highest beds, those
in which <i>Palaeomastodon</i> had been found. Continued search
westwards eventually led to the discovery of the remains of a large
and remarkable horned ungulate (<i>Arsinoitherium</i>), a
preliminary notice<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of which was published in the spring of
1902. Shortly after, the remains of several new smaller mammals and
reptiles (<i>Phiomia</i>, <i>Saghatherium</i>), including the shell
of a large land tortoise (<i>Testudo Ammon</i>), were
obtained<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a>. Further work in the winters of 1902-03-04 led
to a great deal more material being obtained<a id=
"FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
mostly of course belonging to the same species, but including some
new genera <i>Geniohyus</i>, <i>Megalohyrax</i>,
<i>Pterodon</i>.</p>

<p>The amount of palaeontological material is now so large that the
Egyptian Government has arranged with the Trustees of the British
Museum for the publication of the whole in a monograph to be issued
by the Trustees. The present report, therefore, deals only with the
geology and topography of the district.</p>

"p1"></a>PART I.</h2>

<p class="sch">TOPOGRAPHY AND STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY.</p>

<hr class="decor width4">

<p class="nind space-above2"><span class="sc">The</span> Fayûm, a
large circular depression in the Libyan Desert, is situated
immediately west of that part of the Nile Valley lying between Kafr
el Ayat and Feshn (<a href="#i17">Plate XVII.</a>)</p>

<p>The depression, which has an area, roughly speaking, of 12,000
square kilometres, is primarily divisible into three distinct
parts—cultivated land, lake, and desert.</p>

<h3><a id="s01"></a><span class="sc">Section</span> I.—CULTIVATED
LAND.</h3>

<p>The cultivated land has an area of about 1,800 square kilometres
and, with the exception of the lake and part of the Wadi Rayan,
occupies the lowest part of the depression. Cultivation is
necessarily strictly limited to the area covered with alluvial
soil. The latter, for the most part identical in origin and
composition with the river-alluvium of the Nile Valley, covers a
leaf-shaped tract between the bounding desert on the east side and
the lake (the Birket el Qurûn) on the north-west. The easterly and
central part of the cultivated area forms a more or less level
table-land, from which the ground slopes gently away, especially on
the north side, where the slope is towards the lake and very
marked. The cultivated land of the Fayûm is directly connected with
that of the Nile Valley by a narrow strip of low ground, a natural
passage through the desert separating the Nile Valley and the
depression of the Fayûm. Through this gap runs the natural canal
known as the Bahr Yusef, which is practically the sole source of
water in the Fayûm and irrigates the entire district.</p>

<p>The canal leaves the Nile Valley at Lahûn (<a href="#i02">Plate
II</a>), and follows a somewhat serpentine course through the
desert for about 5 kilometres, irrigating a narrow strip of land on
either side, which at Hawara rapidly broadens out into the wide
cultivated area of the Fayûm. Once within the latter, the Bahr
Yusef gives off numerous subsidiary canals which traverse the
country in all directions, constantly splitting up into smaller
branches until the water-supply is divided throughout the whole
area. With the exception of the self-contained basin of Gharaq, on
the south side of the Fayûm, the entire district drains into the
Birket el Qurûn, which occupies the lowest part of the depression,
to the north of the cultivation. The basin of Gharaq is irrigated
by the Bahr el Gharaq, a canal which takes off from the Bahr Yusef
soon after the latter enters the Fayûm<a id=
"FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>The cultivated
land of the Fayûm is traversed by two main ravines, cut down in
many places to the Eocene limestone below the alluvium (Plates
<a href="#i03">III</a> and <a href="#i05">V.</a>) At the present
time these ravines carry canals for irrigating the lower parts of
the district, and also act largely as drains to the higher lands.
They were probably initiated by the escape of water through
breaches in the Bahr Yusef during flood time, and have since been
deepened to their present dimensions.</p>

<p>In addition to the main central cultivated area, the soil of
which, as mentioned above, is essentially identical with that of
the Nile Valley, large tracts of the surrounding country, more
especially on the north, north-west, and west sides, are also
covered with alluvial deposits. These latter, which include sands,
sandy clays, and clays of a quite distinct type, represent the
slowly formed accumulations of the quieter and more remote parts of
the ancient Lake Moeris (and the earlier prehistoric lake). The
material was mostly derived from the Eocene strata which formed the
shores of the lake, augmented no doubt by a certain amount of very
fine sediment drifted from the Bahr Yusef, and by sand blown in by
wind.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that the thickest and most sandy deposits occur
near the borders of the lake site; when close under the Eocene
cliffs, as along the north side above the Birket el Qurûn, the
deposits closely resemble those of the latter. The finer more
calcareous beds occur further out and the true marls were
accumulated only at some distance from the shores of the lake.</p>

<p>When in Ptolemaic times the lake became reduced to a fraction of
its former size, large areas covered by these lacustrine clays were
exposed and some portions were brought under cultivation.
Subsequently, however, all these outlying districts were abandoned
and became absorbed by the surrounding desert, until in modern
times the cultivation was restricted to the central portion of the
old lake bed, a portion almost identical with the area over which
true “Nile Mud” had been deposited.</p>

<p>The construction during recent years of extensive irrigation
works in the Nile Valley has made it possible to largely augment
the water-supply of the Bahr Yusef to the Fayûm. High level canals
are being cut in various parts of the district and already large
areas of desert covered by these lacustrine deposits have been
brought under cultivation, notably to the north of Tamia and in the
neighbourhood of Qasr Qurûn. The approximate area covered with
lacustrine deposits can be seen on the map and with a sufficiency
of water probably the greater part of this area could be utilized,
though the exact value of the soil compared with Nile deposit
remains to be determined.</p>

<h3><a id="s02"></a><span class="sc">Section</span> II.—THE BIRKET
EL QURUN.</h3>

<p>The lowest part of the depression, lying immediately to the
north-west of the cultivation, is occupied by a sheet of water of
considerable size, known as the Birket el Qurûn.<a id=
"FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
The lake, which has a length of 40 kilometres, and a maximum
breadth under ten, covers at the present time an area of about 225
square kilometres. Sir Hanbury Brown obtained no sounding exceeding
5 metres in crossing the lake to Dimê, but according to the
fishermen the depth increases towards the south-west.</p>

<p>Its long axis lies nearly east and west, and while on the north
it is entirely<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a> bordered by desert, along a large part of the
south side the cultivated land approaches its shore, although even
here a large area actually bordering the lake is waste salty land
as yet unfit for cultivation. As already mentioned, with the
exception of the Gharaq basin, the lake receives the whole drainage
from the cultivated lands.</p>

<p>The Birket el Qurûn is the existing remnant of the ancient
prehistoric lake which covered a large part of the floor of the
Fayûm depression, and which in historic times was converted into an
artificially controlled sheet of water—the celebrated Moeris—by
Amenemhat I and his successors in the XII Dynasty.</p>

<p>Lake Moeris, being used as a regulator of excessively high and
low Nile floods,<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a> was of the greatest importance in connection
with the irrigation of the Nile Valley. In more recent times,
apparently under the Persians or Ptolemies according to Flinders
Petrie,<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> Lake Moeris ceased to perform its function of
regulator; since that time all water, except that required for
irrigation of the reclaimed land, being carefully excluded, the
surface of the lake has continually and gradually sunk to its
modern dimensions.<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Lacustrine deposits, showing approximately the actual limits of
the ancient Fayûm lake, can be traced over wide areas of now barren
desert; these will be more fully dealt with later. The present
lake-level is still continually sinking owing to an improved system
of irrigation, by which a constantly decreasing amount of waste
water drains into the lake. Its average annual fall has, during the
last decade, been nearly half a metre,<a id=
"FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and the slope of the land being very gradual, large areas have been
reclaimed during the last few years, though whether the advantages
derived from this constant lowering of the lake are not more than
balanced by certain drawbacks is somewhat doubtful.<a id=
"FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>With the new areas now being brought under cultivation the
amount of drainage water finding its way into the lake will
increase and the fall be checked. At the beginning of 1904 the
level was markedly higher than in the previous winter, and a
difference of even half a metre alters the shore line to a
considerable extent, owing to the flatness of the land by which the
lake is for the most part bounded.</p>

<p>Although under the present desert conditions practically no
material from the surrounding desert is washed into the lake,
doubtless a considerable amount of fine dust and sand is carried
into it by the wind, especially during the violent sandstorms which
occur frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> in
the locality. The high cliffs which bound the northern shore of the
lake throughout a portion of its length probably have the effect of
checking the velocity of both north and south winds, thus causing a
considerable amount of sand, which would otherwise be carried
across, to be dropped on its surface. This material, together with
the fine mud brought down by the canals on the cultivation sides,
must have an appreciable effect in raising the level of the bed of
the lake.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of the extraordinary freshness of the water of
the Birket el Qurûn has been commented on by Schweinfurth, who
shows that the degree of concentration of salt in a lake whose
volume has been continually reduced, and to which salt has
constantly been added, should be many times greater than the actual
existing amount. An analysis<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of the water at the west
end of the lake (where the concentration is greatest, owing to the
distance from the feeder canals) showed that the total salts
amounted to only 1·34%, of which 0·92% was sodium chloride. Dr.
Schweinfurth<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class=
"fnanchor">[15]</a> concludes that the lake has a subterranean
outlet, which alone would enable it to maintain its comparative
freshness.<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a> In this connection it is interesting to note
the existence of distinct currents, which may possibly be caused by
such outlets, in certain localities on the north side of the lake;
and it is just possible that a careful survey of the lake itself
would not only prove the existence, but show the exact position, of
such underground outlets.</p>

<p>Most probably, however, the currents are simply local movements
produced by temporary differences of level, which might conceivably
be caused in such a large and comparatively shallow sheet of water,
varying considerably in salinity in different localities, by wind
and evaporation.</p>

<p>The comparative freshness of the lake and the possible presence
of underground outlets are of the highest importance in their
bearing directly on two of the most important questions in
connection with the proposed utilization of the Wadi Rayan as a
reservoir, i.e. what the leakage from such a reservoir would be and
to what degree of salinity its water would attain.</p>

<h3><a id="s03"></a><span class="sc">Section</span> III.—THE
SURROUNDING DESERT REGION.</h3>

<p>With the exception of the lake and the cultivated area the
depression is practically entirely desert. The southern and
south-western parts include the wadies Rayan and Muêla, where
freshwater springs occur, surrounded by areas covered by a good
deal of wild scrub. Apart from these, however, no springs occur
outside the cultivated land.</p>

<p>The topography of the region is so intimately connected with its
geological structure that an adequate description of the former is
not possible without constant reference to the latter. Full
geological details will, however, be reserved for later
consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span><span class=
"sidenote">Area and Limits.</span>The part of the Libyan Desert
dealt with in this report has, excluding the cultivated land and
the lake, an area of some ten thousand square kilometres. While
some portions have been examined and mapped in detail, others are
still very imperfectly known, especially on the south and
south-west sides. The irregular cliff-line forming the southern
boundary of Rayan and the adjacent wadis may be taken as our limit
in this direction, beyond lying an almost unbroken limestone
plateau rising gradually and continually to the south. On the north
and north-west the area under description is bounded by the
southern limit of the great undulating high-lying gravelly
desert-plateau which stretches with little change of character to
the Mediterranean. On the east side the Nile Valley forms a
convenient though not altogether natural boundary; while to the
south-west our limit practically coincides with the boundary of the
depression, where the floor of the latter insensibly merges into
the general desert plateau.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Rocks forming the
Area.</span>The rocks forming the area within the above limits are
almost entirely of sedimentary origin, the exception being a band
of hard basalt intercalated at the very top of the series and
exposed only on the extreme northernmost limit of the depression.
The total thickness of sediments, from the lowest beds exposed in
the bottom of the Wadi Rayan to the summit of the escarpments, a
day’s march north of Tamia, is some 700 metres. These beds include
every kind of sedimentary deposit—limestones, marls, clays,
sandstones, sands and gravels, forming an ever-changing succession
of rocks, varying considerably in hardness and capacity for
withstanding the agents of denudation. It is not too much to say
that the coming into existence of the Fayûm, with its plains,
lowlying depressions, precipitous cliffs and escarpments, was
largely dependent on the existence of this variable series of
deposits.</p>

<p>Apart from the presence of sediments varying greatly in hardness
and durability, the fact that the whole of the rocks have an almost
constant northerly dip of two or three degrees is a point of prime
importance. So small a dip may be scarcely noticeable in any one
place, but over the large areas with which we have to deal its
influence on the position and level of any individual bed is very
marked and the topography of the region would have been essentially
different if the strata had been quite horizontal.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Origin of the
Fayûm.</span>The unique character of the Fayûm is alone sufficient
to show that special causes have acted in its production. Two main
causes stand out:—(1) the presence of thick bands of comparatively
soft arenaceous and argillaceous strata breaking up the usually
continuous hard limestone of the Middle Eocene; (2) the effect of
the Nile Valley fault in lowering the whole of the western desert
(north of Assiut) relatively to the eastern. The former took place
as the result of changed geographical conditions on the continent
to the south at the time in question, with which however we need
not deal here. On a homogeneous mass of rock weathering has little
power to form depressions of any magnitude, and this is the cause
of the continuous unbroken plateau which stretches southwards from
the Fayûm, the underlying rocks being one continuous thick mass of
hard limestone. Wherever softer intercalations<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_16">[16]</span> are present differential weathering takes
place, and all the great depressions of the Libyan desert owe their
origin to the presence of soft easily denuded strata; if the great
homogeneous mass of Nile Valley limestone had stretched unchanged
westwards, the oases of Farafra and Baharia would never have
existed. They owe their origin entirely to the presence of the
underlying saddle of softer Cretaceous rocks. Similarly if changed
conditions had not led to the deposition of soft beds of clay,
marl, and sandstone, the western plateau would have continued
unbroken northwards.</p>

<p>A comparison of the two sides of the Nile Valley between Cairo
and Assiut shows that the tectonic movements, which largely
determined the existence of the valley itself, resulted in a
considerable lowering of the rocks forming the western side. This
was brought about by differential movements along the north and
south line or lines of fault, and by the presence of an east to
west monoclinal fold which is especially well marked in the
neighbourhood of Heluan. The depressions of the Fayûm would
doubtless have existed irrespective of this general lowering of the
western desert relative to the east, but denudation would have
required an additional period of many thousands of years before the
floor of the depression was low enough to allow of its actual
connection with the Nile river.</p>

<p>As it has been maintained that the Fayûm is an area let down and
enclosed by faults, it may be mentioned here that all available
evidence points in an opposite direction; this question of faults
will however be dealt with in detail later. The influence of the
Nile Valley fault has been explained above and it must be
remembered it is one affecting not the Fayûm alone but the northern
part of the western desert as a whole.</p>

<p class="space-above15">For purposes of description it will be
convenient to divide the whole region into three parts: first, the
southern portion, including the wadis Muêla and Rayan; secondly,
the central area, comprising the extensive plain forming the floor
of the depression as a whole, and including the areas under
cultivation and the Birket el Qurûn, as well as the desert
separating the Fayûm from the Nile Valley. Thirdly, the northern
portion, embracing all the rising ground between the floor and the
northern rim of the region. These areas will now be taken in
order.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Colonel Western’s
Survey.</span>In 1882, as a counter-project to other irrigation
schemes, Cope Whitehouse suggested<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href=

the Wadi Rayan, a depression which had been referred to by Linant
de Bellefonds.<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> At the request of Sir Colin Scott Moncrieff the
Government deputed Colonel Western to make plans of the Wadi Rayan
and surrounding country and to ascertain<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_17">[17]</span> the capacity of the depression and its
capability of being used as a reservoir. Liernur Bey under his
direction prepared a contoured map, and Colonel Western’s report,
plans, and estimates were published.<a id=
"FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Some general details of the wadi and surrounding hills are given
and the detailed survey showed that the 30 metre contour line
(above sea-level) enclosed an area of 706 square kilometres
(170,000 feddans). The lowest points of the depression were found
at 42 metres below sea-level. The sand, scrub and springs are
briefly referred to and the discharge of the latter is given as
equal to that of a very slow-going four inch hand pipe, the water
running out at about + 20 m. and disappearing in the sand. Wadi
Muêla was found to be separated from the Rayan depression by
sandhills and rock at a mean level of + 50 metres, the lowest point
in Muêla being at + 25 metres. A line of levels was run from Rayan
through Muêla to the Nile Valley, the highest point crossed being
at + 105 metres; for fifteen kilometres the level was not below +
75 metres. In order to find the most suitable passage for a canal
to connect the Nile with the Wadi Rayan two lines of level were
made after a reconnaissance of the hills near Sidmant el Jebel: the
southern, from Ezba Menesi Ali, near the Gharaq canal, to Mazana on
the Bahr Yusef, being considered the best. Along this line the
highest point was only at + 44·7 metres and the average + 35 metres
along four kilometres. Borings were not made here but judging from
the surface excavation would be mostly in soft limestone, sand, and
conglomerate. A much shorter route is from Deshasleh on the Bahr
Yusef over the hills about 5 kilometres to the south of Mazana or
Sidmant into the Wadi Gharaq, a distance of 30 kilometres. This
route was not however levelled but is fairly straight and
apparently not much higher than the Mazana passage.</p>

<p>The survey of the + 30 metre contour line of the Wadi Rayan
proved that there were only two outlets into the Fayûm, both on the
northern side: these two openings are only from 400-500 metres wide
and their lowest points are not below + 25 or + 26 metres.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Later Government
Publications by Scott Moncrieff and Willcocks.</span>In 1889 Sir C.
Scott Moncrieff published<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> a further note, in which
he briefly discussed the probable cost and benefits to be derived
from the suggested reservoir, concluding that at least the project
was one worthy of being thoroughly examined.</p>

<p>In 1894 the plans and designs in connection with the Wadi Rayan
were published<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a> and the possibility of utilizing the Wadi Rayan
was examined by Sir William Willcocks, then Director General of
Reservoirs, from an engineering point of view, and the questions of
its probable cost and future utility were discussed. In this report
it is stated that the routes proposed by Colonel Western in 1888
pass through salty marls and clays unsuitable for holding canals.
Another route is suggested, which after leaving the Nile Valley
crosses the high desert ridge in a straight line, passing through
the so-called Wadi Liernur (Wadi Lulu of Cope Whitehouse); this
depression is 12 kilometres long and has its bed some 24 metres
below the general level of the desert. Plate 15 of the report shows
the Wadi Rayan, the deserts between it and the Nile Valley and the
cultivated land. The map was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_18">[18]</span> begun by Col. Western and completed by
Willcocks. The lowest point of Wadi Rayan is shown as − 42 metres
and the depression is separated from the Fayûm by a limestone ridge
generally from + 34 to + 60 metres, except at two places where it
falls to + 26 metres above sea level on a length of 600 metres.
Within the + 27 metre contour line the wadi has an area of 673
square kilometres and a capacity of 18,743,000,000 cubic metres.
Between it and the Nile Valley lie 30 kilometres of desert, of
which 11 are occupied by a marked depression discovered by Liernur
Bey in 1887. At the extreme western edge of the Nile Valley (here
20 kilometres wide) runs the Bahr Yusef. Comparing the proposed
Wadi Rayan reservoir and the ancient Mœris and allowing for a
difference of 4·5 metres between the levels of the Nile Valley in
B.C. 2,000 and to-day, Willcocks assumes that the high water mark
of Lake Mœris was at + 22·5 metres and its area 2,500 square
kilometres, against 673 square kilometres of the Wadi Rayan at + 27
metres. It is pointed out that the ancient lake had the great
advantage that in those days the Bahr Yusef was an important branch
of the Nile, if not the main river itself, and the reservoir was
connected with the Nile by a natural ravine of great length and
short breadth, across which a massive embankment was thrown and
destroyed annually, the surplus water of high floods being stored
for the deficiency of low floods.</p>

<p>The published sections along the lines of borings put down show
the different strata cut through by the proposed canal. The Nile
Valley, along the line of the inlet canal, consists of hard clay 6
to 10 metres thick, lying on coarse sand. Along the outlet canal
sandy clays and clays alternate to a depth of 10 metres. On
entering the desert sands and sandy conglomerate, with gypsum and
salt, are met with below the surface, then a yellow marl with
salts, and finally a plastic black clay overlying the Parisian
limestone. These beds are most extensive in the narrow neck of land
between the Nile Valley and the Fayûm and to some 10 kilometres to
the south of it. They rise to + 70 metres. There are some other
marls inside the Wadi Rayan or in the adjacent depressions and as
they have to be traversed by the canals form a serious factor,
being easily dissolved in water; in consequence Willcocks chose the
alignment of the inlet canal along the Bahr Belama where the extent
of these beds would only be 2·5 kilometres against 9 kilometres on
the alternative route marked on the plan. A narrow neck of land,
some 15 kilometres in length, runs between the Fayûm and the
depressions traversed by the proposed Wadi Rayan canal; this neck
is the continuation of the salty marls and clays, but the limestone
is near the surface and is overlain by a thin deposit of sand and
pebbles, with freshwater shells on its northern slope at + 22·50
metres; the southern slope is entirely devoid of them. Willcocks
points out that it is evident the ancient Mœris rose to + 22·50
metres but its water never penetrated into the Wadi Rayan. The
report goes into details of inlet and outlet canals, discharge,
necessary masonry works, cost, and compares the different reservoir
schemes.</p>

<p>After a careful review of the whole question, the scheme, while
considered perfectly feasible as far as available data went, was
abandoned by Sir William Garstin<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in favour of the less
costly and more useful Nubian reservoir.</p>

on the probable salt-content in Wadi Rayan Reservoir.</span>In an
appendix<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class=
"fnanchor">[23]</a> to the above report Schweinfurth discusses the
question as to how salt the water of such a reservoir would become.
He points out that the exact valuation of the salt which would be
contained in this reservoir when the water had risen to + 27 metres
cannot be accurately determined, owing to the absence of
information on certain points. The maximum quantity of salt in the
desert soil is estimated at 2% and this figure is used in his
calculation, which includes the amount of salt which would be
brought into the reservoir, (1) from the Nile during filling and in
the extra water entering to replace that lost by evaporation in the
lake and canals; (2) from the ground forming the bed of the lake
(far the largest item); (3) from the bed and banks of the inlet
canal, both in the desert and in the Nile Valley; and (4) from
infiltration. The figure obtained is 7,500 million kilogrammes,
equal to 0·04 per cent, or almost one twenty-fifth per cent of
salt. This amount is only equivalent to half the salt existing in
many of the well waters used in the country for irrigation. As
Schweinfurth is careful to point out his calculation is based on
maximum and assumed data.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Willcocks’ “Assouan
Reservoir and Lake Mœris”.</span>The question of the utilisation of
the Wadi Rayan as a reservoir has recently been again brought to
the front, notably by Sir William Willcocks in a paper<a id=
"FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
read before the Khedivial Geographical Society, Cairo. The author,
after pointing out the value of such a lake, working in connection
with the Assuan reservoir, discusses at length the position,
dimensions, and functions of the ancient Lake Moeris. It is
suggested that the main canal should be cut through the desert
opposite Mazana and crossing the so-called wadis Liernur and
Masaigega enter the Wadi Rayan at its easternmost point. These
wadis would in time become covered with alluvium and be converted
into valuable cultivated land. After examining the big ravines of
the Fayûm, where similar beds are exposed, the author comes to the
conclusion that the maintenance of canals in the saliferous marls,
which form part of the desert through which the inlet canal would
pass, would offer no particular difficulties.</p>

<p>With regard to the questions of leakage into the Fayûm and of
the water of the lake eventually becoming salted, Sir William
Willcocks says, “When the old Lake Moeris, or the present Fayûm,
was full of water and 63 metres higher than the bottom of the Wadi
Rayan and remained so for thousands of years, there was no question
of the waters having become salted or having escaped into the Wadi.
The Wadi was as dry as it is to-day and the great inland sea was
always fresh.” As to the question of leakage into Gharaq the author
considers that if water found its way into that depression it would
be a distinct advantage, as such water could be pumped into the
Nezleh canal and utilized elsewhere; he maintains at the same time
that no leakage will take place. Incidentally it is mentioned that
the Wadi Rayan is separated from the Fayûm by a limestone ridge, a
statement which, as will be shown later, requires modification.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Wadi Rayan not yet
examined in detail by the Geological Survey of Egypt.</span>Until a
detailed geological examination of the Wadi Rayan and neighbourhood
has been carried out it will not be possible to form reliable
opinions on many of the questions raised in connection with the
prospective reservoir. The writer’s acquaintance with the
area<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> is limited to a
traverse in 1899 from the Nile Valley through Wadi Muêla to Rayan
and thence to Gharaq, and subsequently to a stay of a few days
duration in the neighbourhood of the Rayan springs, after mapping
the extreme south-west of the Fayûm depression. While the
accompanying maps may be taken as representing fairly accurately
the bolder topography of the region, they do not replace the older
contoured maps of the floor of the depression and the country
between it and the Nile Valley to the east, accompanying the report
on “Perennial Irrigation and Flood Protection in Egypt.”</p>

<p class="space-above15">The following description of this part of
the district is based on a traverse from the Nile Valley through
the wadis Muêla and Rayan to Gharaq; the detailed geological
sections measured and examined along the line of route will be
given later.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Traverse from Nile
Valley through Wadi Muêla to Rayan and Gharaq.</span>Between the
village of El Gayat and the mouth of the Wadi Muêla (16 kilometres
to the north-west) stretches a gradually rising undulating gypseous
plain, superficially covered with loose sand and rounded pebbles of
quartz and flint. In occasional small hills the white limestone
which forms the underlying rock is visible. Near the entrance to
the wadi stands a somewhat prominent conical hill composed of hard
whitish fossiliferous limestone passing down into more sandy and
clayey beds. The bottom of the wadi is cut out in soft green and
brown clays, its surface being covered with blown sand, fragments
of limestone, flints and gypsum. From the mouth of the wadi the
Nile Valley cliffs run north and south in a winding irregular
manner. On entering the valley several outstanding flat-topped
limestone capped hills are passed on the right hand; they are in
part joined to the regular bounding cliff beyond; the eastern cliff
is steep and well-marked, while that on the west only outcrops here
and there, buried as it is in immense accumulations of blown sand,
rising in places into definite dune-ridges. Wadi Muêla has a length
of some 18 kilometres and lies nearly N.W. and S.E. The central
part of its floor is a sandy scrub-covered area, the lowest points
lying at about + 25 metres; just at the southern edge of the scrub
stands a small hill composed of hard shaly clays capped by white
limestone, surrounded by a saline, superficially dry. Holes dug in
this are at once filled with excessively salt water, and by
evaporation of the brine in shallow troughs supplies of white
fairly pure salt can be obtained. The area is known as <span class=
"sidenote">Warshat el Melh in Wadi Muêla.</span>Warshat el Melh.
Banks of reeds were found growing on the north side of the saline,
the surface of the latter being here composed of a soft brown sandy
salty deposit, caking here and there into a hard earthy impure
salt.</p>

<p>In the lowest spots the saline frequently consists of soft wet
sludge; its area is about half a square kilometre but the depth of
the deposit is unknown. In the middle of the scrub-covered area to
the north lies Ain Warshat el Melh, a pool of water, fairly fresh
and drinkable, although ferruginous, measuring 10 by 5 metres in
size and from 2 to 2½ metres deep. The water evidently rises from a
spring on the west side, round which are fifty square metres of
green rushes, with some larger bushes. The ground around and above
is very saliferous; between the spring and the ruins to the north
the ground is sandy, with many bushes and much scrub. This ground
extends two kilometres<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_21">[21]</span> to the west, whence it gradually passes up
into great masses of drift sand; an occasional small outcrop of the
top of the plateau above the sand is all that serves to locate the
position of the buried cliff. On the east side the sandy ground
with scrub extends about a kilometre, beyond which the plain
gradually rises for another kilometre to the base of the cliff
beyond, which is fairly steep and well-marked, though with an
entire absence of indentations of any kind.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Der el
Galamûn.</span>Close to the north end of the valley, and about 33
kilometres from El Gayat, lie the ruins known as Der el Galamûn bil
Muêla. At the time of our visit a new square stone building was in
course of erection and five or six persons were inhabiting the
place. There are several small palms scattered about to the south
of the monastery and an excellent running spring of clear water
five hundred paces to the south-west. A new well is being sunk
within the premises. To the north of the monastery the eastern
cliff takes a marked trend to the west for some three kilometres,
whence it resumes a northerly direction, always maintaining its
character of a steep well-marked escarpment rising some 100 metres
above the floor of the wadi. At the corner of the cliffs the lowest
bed exposed is a white limestone; this is overlain by gypseous
clays passing up into sandy beds, the latter being surmounted by
the white limestone capping the escarpment.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Wadi
Rayan.</span>We are here on the summit of the divide between Wadi
Muêla and Wadi Rayan, the height of the floor being about + 105
metres; to the north stretches a gradually widening bay descending
to the lowest ground of the Rayan depression. Immense accumulations
of sand almost block the defile and stretch away to the east, and
the hitherto well-marked cliff on that side bends back and is lost
to view. On the other side however, the bounding wall gradually
emerges from the dunes, getting more distinct as it is followed
northwards until it becomes quite clear of the sand. The first
glimpse of this cliff is seen a couple of kilometres west of the
pass in an outcropping headland, the next point visible being some
five kilometres further west. Between these portions of the cliff
are one or two outliers, surrounded by quantities of blown sand. A
depression known as Wadi Korif is reported to lie to the west, and
much scrub and some water is said to exist there; such a wadi is
marked on Schweinfurth’s map but apparently has not been
examined.</p>

<p>Continuing in a N.N.W. direction high rather steep dunes occur
on either flank, running N.N.W. and S.S.E. Between the dunes is a
fairly hard undulating sand-flat affording an easy route; further
on a narrow defile between the dunes leads down to the centre of
the depression. The main areas occupied by blown sand are shown in
the accompanying maps. The most interesting part of the depression
is the bay lying to the south of the narrow well-marked promontory
jutting out from the southern plateau, a huge pointer, as it were,
in the direction of Gharaq; this is the Cape Rayan of
Schweinfurth.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_22">[22]</span><span class="sidenote">Springs in Wadi
Rayan.</span>The bay is on three sides completely enclosed by
cliffs and its floor is thickly covered by a luxurious growth of
wild scrub—chiefly tamarisk and ghardag; numerous isolated palm
trees occur, especially in the neighbourhood of the water which
exists at several points. There are three particularly good
springs,<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class=
"fnanchor">[25]</a> the positions of which are shown on the
accompanying <a href="#i17">maps.</a> According to Colonel
Western’s survey the water emerges at about + 20 metres. In 1899
the water of the northern spring was found to have a temperature of
26°C. On our last visit we found an artificially constructed pool
of two metres diameter and a depth of 30 centimetres; on the west
side of this were two springs, marked by the motion of the grey
sand rising and falling in the vents, down which a stick could be
easily pushed to a depth of two metres. The output of these springs
together amounted to six litres a minute; the water was quite clear
and although soft and rather ferruginous not by any means
unpalatable (see <a href="#Footnote_25">analyses</a> below). The
pool lies on an open bare sandy spot and is surrounded by scattered
bushes, none of which however are within fifteen metres; a sand
dune lies 150 metres to the south-west, with bushes and seven or
eight young palms. The southerly spring has an output of 21 litres
a minute, and its water does not differ essentially from that of
the northern spring. Rising at the foot of a palm tree it forms
pools on either side; thence it flows a distance of 20 metres into
an artificially constructed shallow basin 2 to 3 metres across,
from which it runs away down the slope and disappears after five or
six metres. The east spring, which is situated on the east side of
the dunes bounding the mouth of the bay, consists of a small hole
cut out in soft sand. The water seemed good, although analysis
shows the salts content to be high; this spring does not run, but
if emptied the hole soon refills. The remains of old buildings
occur near the well, in the shape of loose roughly squared
limestone blocks, broken pottery, and remains of old walls; the
latter are nearly level with the ground and very thickly and
solidly built.</p>

<p>To the south of the promontory lies the so-called Little Rayan.
Here there is a good deal of scrub, and water can be obtained on
the lowest ground at a few metres depth, although there do not
appear to be any surface springs.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Geology of Wadi
Rayan in broad outline.</span>The geological succession of beds
exposed in the cliffs of the promontory is given later. Broadly
speaking it consists of two thirty-metre bands of hard limestone
separated by 68 metres of softer sandy and clayey beds. The lower
of the limestone bands in places forms the floor of the depression
but more frequently the latter is composed of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_23">[23]</span> the overlying sandy or clayey beds. The
depression is bounded on the north side by the same succession,
and, as far as could be judged from observations made on the
traverse, the bed of limestone capping the ridge, and forming the
plain stretching away to the Birket el Qurûn and to Gar el
Gehannem, is identical with that capping the cliffs to the south,
i.e. is the uppermost of the two thick limestone bands. At the two
points more particularly noticed, namely, the spurs projecting
southwards into the depression, 23 kilometres west and 18
kilometres W.S.W. of Gharaq basin, the sequence seemed to be the
same as in the southern cliffs, although, owing to the northerly
dip, the upper bed of limestone lies at a much lower level and the
basal beds are not exposed at all. In both these localities,
however, some of the underlying clays were exposed, as well as on
the lowest spots crossed between the most easterly spur (18 kilom.
W.S.W. of Gharaq) and the extensive dunes lying immediately west of
Gharaq cultivation. These dunes, though of no height, have
remarkably steep sides. In crossing Gharaq to the Fayûm cultivation
occasional beds of yellow sandy limestone were noticed, but their
horizon was not determined. Numerous bored blocks, probably
belonging to the marine Pliocene, were observed scattered about.
Apparently the uppermost thirty-metre band of limestone passes
continuously northwards under the cultivated lands of Gharaq and
the Fayûm; in the ravines of the latter this limestone is not
observed, the soft limestones exposed below the alluvial deposits
almost certainly belonging to the overlying Ravine beds. The
country to the east of Gharaq has not been geologically examined
and the exact locality in which the thick bed of limestone dips
underground and is overlain by the succeeding beds is doubtful.
Further north, in the desert ridge east of Qalamsha, we have
observed the Birket el Qurûn beds and a section measured at this
point is given later.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Character of Ridge
separating Wadi Rayan from Gharaq and the Fayûm.</span>As it
appears to have been freely assumed that the ridge separating the
Rayan depression from the cultivated lands of Gharaq and the Fayûm
is formed throughout of solid limestone, it is important to point
out that, on our assumption of the identity of the beds of
limestone capping the cliffs to the south and the plain to the
north of the Wadi Rayan, the dividing ridge would in part be formed
of the underlying arenaceous and argillaceous beds.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Question of leakage
through dividing ridge.</span>The absence of Nile deposit and
freshwater shells in the Wadi Rayan will, when confirmed after a
thorough examination of the area, afford the strongest evidence
that the depression was never directly flooded by Nile water. The
fact that the dividing ridge is probably everywhere above the
highest level attained by Lake Mœris, and by the still more ancient
prehistoric lake, is almost sufficient in itself as a proof of
this. It does not however follow that there was not leakage through
the ridge into the Rayan basin, as such leakage might conceivably
have taken place to a considerable extent without the water ever
having collected in sufficient quantities to form even moderate
sized pools within the depression. The bottom of the depression is
for the most part covered with soft porous sandy deposits overlying
the Eocene bed-rock below, and at the present time the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> water of the Rayan springs,
though continually running, at once disappears from sight, drains
down to the lowest parts of the depression and is then gradually
lost by evaporation or underground leakage. In the lowest parts of
the depression this water is, as already mentioned, met with on
digging to a very moderate depth.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the flanks of the ridge separating the
Fayûm and Gharaq cultivated areas from Rayan might prove if such
leakage ever took place. If such was the case the seepage was
probably along the line of junction of the limestone and underlying
clayey or sandy beds. Even if it were proved that there never was
leakage from Lake Mœris into Wadi Rayan, it would not be safe to
assume that the converse would not happen, as the dip of the beds
is from south to north and this fact is one to be reckoned with.
Judging from the nature of the Eocene beds forming the Wadi Rayan,
my opinion is that leakage on a large scale would not take place,
and that owing to the northerly dip any water that escaped from the
reservoir would pass indefinitely northwards and would not find its
way through the overlying limestone to the surface either in Gharaq
or the Fayûm cultivation. A detailed examination of the local
geology would, however, be necessary to prove or disprove this. As
to the question whether the Wadi Rayan as a whole would hold water,
as far as is known there are no faults or other fissures of any
magnitude through which the water could escape. No doubt a good
deal of water would be lost before the smaller joints and passages,
which exist in all rocks, were silted up. Schweinfurth supposes
that the freshness of the Birket el Qurûn is due to the existence
of subterranean outlets, and such might also be found to exist in
the Wadi Rayan. In any case the argillaceous deposits from such a
lake would very soon form a bed to all intents and purposes
impermeable.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Degree of
Salinity.</span>With regard to the extent of salinity of such a
lake Dr. Schweinfurth’s figures are of considerable interest and
value, although based wholly on assumed data. The greater part of
the salt would be derived from the rocks and soil forming the bed
of the reservoir and only by extensive sample collecting and
analysis can reliable figures be obtained. We believe that in the
lowest parts of the basin the salt content of the ground would be
found considerably in excess of the two per cent used by
Schweinfurth in his calculation, although his total estimate would
probably be found well within the mark.</p>

<h3><a id="s05"></a><span class="sc">Section</span> V.—CENTRAL AREA
OF THE REGION.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Central Plain at the Fayûm
Depression.</span>The great central plain, forming the floor of the
depression as a whole, is composed of a hard bed of limestone some
thirty metres thick. This limestone, forming the uppermost member
of the Rayan series, is, as already mentioned, almost certainly
identical with that capping the cliffs to the south of the
depression, and in all probability in the eastern extension of the
plain under description underlies the whole of the cultivated lands
of Gharaq and the Fayûm. The feature of the plain as a whole is its
marked and constant, though low, dip to the north; so that its
surface, bared by denudation of the overlying<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_25">[25]</span> soft limestones of the Ravine series, over
a distance of some twenty kilometres, is a true dip-slope, at the
base of which lies a strip of low-lying country extending from
beyond Gar el Gehannem through the Birket el Qurûn to the Nile
Valley ridge east of Tamia. The central and lowest portion of this
low-lying area is occupied by the Birket el Qurûn, the bed of which
lies fifty metres below sea level and is thus the lowest known spot
in the whole of the Libyan desert. Thirty kilometres south-west of
the western end of the lake, at the base of the dip-slope of the
central plain and immediately under the southern scarps of the
great outlying hill-mass west of Gar el Gehannem, lies another low
lying basin, which receives the drainage from a considerable area
of the plain to the south-west. The latter, consisting of the
limestone above-mentioned, is here superficially covered by gravel,
and its dark undulating surface is scored by numerous shallow
winding water-courses marked by an abundant growth of scrubby
vegetation; some of the principal of these drain into the basin
just mentioned and after heavy rainfall the water collects and
forms a pool 600 metres in length by 100 to 150 metres wide. The
base of the basin, at about 80 metres above sea level, is marked by
a level deposit of silt of considerable thickness, the east end of
the site being surrounded by great numbers of luxuriantly growing
tamarisks. Other similar basins exist on the plain to the south,
and under an isolated hill five kilometres W.S.W. several full
grown acacias were noticed. On the low ground to the north-west of
Gar el Gehannem, and at several points between it and the head of
the Birket el Qurûn, similar silt covered areas exist, some being
only from 30 to 40 metres above sea level.</p>

<p>In the extreme south-west of the region the limestone forming
the central plain is gradually overlain by the succeeding beds, so
that the ground rises imperceptibly to the level of the plateau
separating the depression from that of Baharia, distant some two
days march. On the eastern side, if the superficial alluvial
deposits could be stripped off, the underlying surface of
limestone, sloping from south to north, would not differ materially
from the plain further west, except that here, at any rate north of
Gharaq, the Rayan limestone is overlain by the basal beds of the
Ravine series.</p>

<h3><a id="s06"></a><span class="sc">Section</span> VI.—RIDGE
SEPARATING THE NILE VALLEY AND THE FAYUM.</h3>

<p>The desert ridge separating the Nile Valley from the Fayûm has,
to the north of the Bahr Yusef, an average width of some ten
kilometres; further south it narrows, until due east of Gharaq the
ridge is barely 2½ kilometres wide. The highest points are situated
to the east of Sersena and Qalamsha respectively.</p>

<p>In both these localities the Eocene rocks, consisting of clays
alternating with beds of calcareous sandstone and sandy limestone
(pp. 39, 40) are overlain by thick deposits of conglomerate and
gravel, attaining altitudes of over 100 metres above the cultivated
land below. From these summits the slope is usually very gradual on
the Nile Valley side but much more rapid towards the Fayûm.</p>

<p>The ridge is cut down, however, to a comparatively low level in
four localities; to the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_26">[26]</span> north-east of Tamia; to the east of Sêla,
where the railway crosses; between Lahûn and Hawara, where the Bahr
Yusef canal enters; and to the south of Qalamsha, where along the
site of the proposed Wadi Rayan canal the highest point is only
some 40 metres above the Gharaq basin and 27 metres above the
adjoining Nile Valley cultivation.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Outline of earliest
connection of Nile with Fayûm.</span>One of the most interesting
problems connected with the Fayûm may be briefly alluded to
here—When did the waters of the Nile first obtain access to the
depression?</p>

<p>As will be shown later the Fayûm was occupied by the sea in
Pliocene times, when the great gravel accumulations and gypseous
deposits were formed. Later the area became dry and denudation of
the land surface completed the work of erosion already begun in
earlier times.</p>

<p>In Pleistocene times drainage down the Nile Valley appears to
have become definitely established and probably the river in the
lower part of its course eventually washed up against and broke
down the separating barrier of gravel between the Fayûm and the
Nile Valley, so that part of its waters obtained access to the
depression, formed a lake on the lowest part, and gradually rose
until the whole basin, up to the level of the channel connecting it
with the Nile Valley, became filled. Every year thousands of tons
of sediment were carried in by the floods and spread out on the
floor in the shape of a fan. Probably later, as the Nile level
fell, the valley and the depression again became disconnected,
until the more modern river, with its gradually rising bed, again
attained the requisite altitude. In early historic times the
alluvial deposits had probably silted up the lake in its southern
central part, and when in the XIIth dynasty the district was first
taken in hand by Amenemhat I this part of it must have had the
character of a huge marsh, nearly surrounded by open water, rapidly
deepening towards the north.</p>

<h3><a id="s07"></a><span class="sc">Section</span> VII.—THE
NORTHERN DESERT REGION.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Plateau bounding the Fayûm depression
to the north.</span>All along the north-west and north sides the
ground rises rapidly from the base of the dip-slope of the plain in
a series of escarpments to the summit of the rim of the depression,
averaging 340 metres above sea level. Northwards from the summit
stretches a rolling pebbly desert, the prevailing character of
which is a dark brown, relieved by lighter brown grey and yellow
patches, and especially flecked by the light sandy slopes of the
undulations. Although the latter seldom rise to any considerable
height above the general level of the plain, from the top of the
most modest eminence an immense view in every direction can
frequently be obtained. The monotony of this desert is only
relieved by the occasional belts of sand, which although extremely
narrow in width, run for immense distances in almost absolutely
straight lines, and in a N.N.W.—S.S.E. direction. Although none of
these dunes actually reach the rim of the escarpment we may mention
here the beautiful Ghart el Khanashat, an almost straight and
apparently unbroken ridge of sand, extremely narrow but of great
length. Near its southern extremity the width does not exceed 100
metres; the slopes on both sides are frequently as much as 30°. The
commencement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> the
Ghart el Khanashat was observed on a march from Wadi Natrûn to
Mogara; it lay some way to the south of a line joining those two
localities but could not be accurately fixed from the line of
route. The belt dies out 24 kilometres from the rim of the Fayûm
depression, its termination being particularly abrupt, although the
height of the ridge diminishes gradually throughout the last
kilometre or two. The line of the belt if continued would almost
strike the western extremity of the Birket el Qurûn; near its
termination the desert is almost flat, the surface being finely
gravelly, with numerous groups of silicified trees; tufts of coarse
grass grow in some profusion on the sandy ground at the base of the
ridge on either side. A fairly well-marked road from the Birket el
Qurûn to the Wadi Natrûn passes the end of the ridge and continues
northwards at a distance of 200 metres from the east side of the
dunes, although apparently gradually diverging eastwards.</p>

<p>Except to the north and north-west of Tamia, where a somewhat
extensive and fairly level plain exists, the ground, as already
mentioned, rises from the limits of the central plain in a series
of escarpments to the summit of the rim of the depression. These
cliff lines are broadly speaking three in number and represent the
escarpments of the three great rock-stages which build up the
northern part of the Fayûm, i.e., the Birket el Qurûn series, the
Qasr el Sagha series, and the Fluvio-marine series. It would serve
no useful purpose describing these different cliffs in detail;
their positions and characters are apparent on the accompanying
maps. The intervening plateaux are for the most part dip-slope
plains formed of hard bands of rock, which resisting denudation,
are left protecting the underlying strata while the softer beds
above are cut back at a comparatively rapid rate.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Desert west and
south-west of Gar el Gehannem.</span>In December 1902 and March
1903 a traverse was made through the unexplored country west and
south-west of Gar el Gehannem, finally connecting up with Wadi
Rayan. The highest escarpment, i.e. that of the Fluvio-marine
series, dies out about 20 kilometres west of Gar el Gehannem,
gradually merging into the undulating gravel-covered plain. The
lower escarpments, those of the Qasr el Sagha and Birket el Qurûn
series, continue to a considerable distance in a south-westerly
direction, although gradually losing the characters of well-marked
cliffs. In fact westwards of this the depression gradually
shallows, until at a point some 50 kilometres south-west of Gar el
Gehannem the floor has attained the level of the ordinary desert
plateau, on which the outcrops of the beds of successive
rock-stages follow one another in regular order from south to
north, but without forming well-marked topographical features, as
in the depression.</p>

<p>Hills, capped with dark hard ferruginous silicified grits and
puddingstone, were met with in the extreme south-west extension of
the depression; these deposits, which will be referred to more
fully later, considered in conjunction with the similar beds
occurring within the oasis of Baharia, and in the hills of Gar el
Hamra, on the plateau immediately to the north-east of that
depression, are of considerable interest and importance, especially
in connection with the question of the position of the early rivers
which in Eocene and later times brought down quantities of trees
and animals, the remains of which are so abundant throughout the
later Fayûm deposits.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_28">[28]</span><span class="sidenote">Jebel el Qatrani and
escarpments north of the Birket el Qurûn.</span>The boldest part of
the region is the area lying between the Birket el Qurûn and the
summit of the depression to the north. All three lines of cliff are
here high and precipitous, and the uppermost escarpment, well known
by the name of Jebel el Qatrani, formed of a highly coloured series
of sandstones and clays and capped for a distance of many
kilometres by a thick bed of hard black basalt, is of a most
striking character. The eastern extremity of Jebel el Qatrani is
perhaps the most conspicuous point in the whole region; here the
two conical black basalt-capped cliff-outliers, known as Widan el
Faras, stand side by side, and from their summits the eye commands
the whole region from the pyramid of Lahûn on the one side, across
Rayan to the south, up to the extreme limits of the depression to
the south-west. The rim of Jebel el Qatrani has a fairly constant
level of about 340 metres above the sea. From Widan el Faras the
escarpment trends northwards for a few kilometres before again
resuming an easterly direction, which is continued till the
well-marked bluff of Elwat Hialla is reached. From this summit the
pyramids of Dashûr, Saqâra and Giza are visible to the north, as
well as Cairo and the Nile Valley southwards, backed by the bluffs
on the Eastern desert limestone plateau.</p>

<p>To the south the isolated peaks of Garat el Gindi and Garat el
Faras form conspicuous landmarks on the more or less open plain
which stretches to Tamia and the limits of the Fayûm cultivated
lands. Eastwards the escarpments continue in a broken irregular
manner; the upper ones are gradually lost in an undulating plain,
while the lower eventually join those forming the northern part of
the ridge separating the Fayûm from the Nile Valley.</p>

supports my original conclusion<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> that the depression owes
its origin to the same causes as have given rise to the other
oases-depressions of the Libyan Desert, namely Baharia, Farafra,
Dakhla and Kharga<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. No evidence has as yet been met with
which would suggest that earth-movements have played any important
part in the formation of the Fayûm depression. Local faults, for
the most part of short length and slight throw, occur at certain
points, but the influence of these is strictly limited to their
immediate neighbourhood. In fact, an examination of the desert
margin of the Fayûm conclusively proves that the depression has
been cut out through the action of ordinary subaerial denuding
agents. The somewhat prevalent idea that the central portion of the
depression, that covered by alluvial soil and the water of the
lake, is faulted down, also rests on no foundation, all available
evidence pointing in an opposite direction. Throughout the margin
of the alluvial covered area the Eocene beds forming the surface of
the desert can be observed to pass regularly under the cultivated
lands; moreover, the same strata are frequently exposed in the
bottoms of canals, drains, etc., far within the cultivation. The
big drainage ravines of El Bats and El Wadi are, through a large
part of their courses, cut down to the underlying Eocene rocks
(Ravine beds), and in every locality examined the strata were found
in the position they would be expected to occupy if undisturbed by
tectonic movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>The method
employed in this boring was such as to bring up the material as a
ground-up paste, an examination of which does not afford absolutely
conclusive evidence as to the age of the rock. The absence, after
the first 18·5 metres, of sand or pebbles, common throughout the
alluvial deposits of the Fayûm, suggests that the base of these
beds was reached at that depth, but from this evidence alone it
would perhaps hardly be satisfactory to conclude that the
underlying 112·5 metres were entirely Eocene. Considering, however
that in the two deep ravines of El Bats and El Wadi the underlying
Eocene is very commonly exposed at an average depth of some 15
metres below cultivation level, it is highly improbable that in the
centre of the area, at Medinet el Fayûm, the alluvial deposits
greatly exceed the same thickness. To classify the 112·5 metres of
marly clays as alluvium would give the latter a total thickness of
131 metres and would mean that over an extremely restricted area
the Eocene rocks had been denuded to such an extent that the floor
of the depression lay 108 metres below sea-level. The ground-up
samples of rock closely resemble what might be expected from the
clays and marls forming the Ravine beds and in all probability the
greater part of the 112·5 metres belong to that series. The harder
stone met with at 131 metres, which, with the exception of a band
of soft clay, continued down to the bottom, must be regarded as
belonging to the underlying Rayan series.</p>

and in a section drawn from Abshawai to the summit of the plateau
north of the lake.<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Stratigraphical evidence, based on the
supposed identity of certain strata in different localities, is
brought forward in support of these faults, the author finally
stating that the production of the Fayûm is clearly and distinctly
to be referred to tectonic movements.</p>

<p>Our conclusion, formed after an examination of the region in
some detail, is so diametrically opposed to the above, that it may
be worth while to state here the evidence which we consider
sufficient to refute the existence of the particular faults
described by Blanckenhorn.</p>

<p>Blanckenhorn’s fault-lines lie for the most part within the area
covered by the alluvial deposits and the water of the lake, so that
for want of exposures it is in most cases impossible to directly
disprove their existence, although strong presumptive evidence
against them can be adduced. The fault along the east side,
however, is shown as closely following the junction line of the
desert and the cultivated land, but everywhere along this line we
found the marls and limestones of the Ravine beds passing regularly
from the desert under the cultivated lands, without any sort of
break or dislocation. Moreover, an examination of the desert ridge
to the east disproved the existence of any faulting on the desert
side, while the appearance of the same beds in the ravine of El
Bats, a few kilometres to the west, proved the continuity of the
beds under the cultivated alluvium in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_31">[31]</span> this direction. Certainly no fault exists
along this side of the Fayûm. Similarly with regard to the fault
shown as running from the west end of the lake along the west side
of the Fayûm cultivation into the basin of Gharaq; although the
desert margin along this side of the Fayûm cultivation has not been
so closely surveyed as that on the east side, no evidence in favour
of the existence of faults was met with in the particular
localities examined. With regard to the third main bounding fault,
considered by Blanckenhorn to run throughout the length of the
Birket el Qurûn and to be continued eastwards, possibly to the Nile
Valley and at least to join the fault on the east side of the
cultivation, we need only say that an examination of the desert
near Tamia disproves its existence at that end; while it is
difficult to imagine that a fault could traverse the lake from end
to end without revealing its presence in the island Geziret el Qorn
or in one or other of the promontories which jut out so far into
the lake from its northern shore. Everywhere the strata are
undisturbed and occupy their normal stratigraphical level and
position.</p>

<p>Let us finally examine the series of more or less parallel
faults stated to exist between the island and the northern shore of
the lake, and on the mainland to the north and south of Dimê. Dr.
Blanckenhorn publishes a detailed section (op. cit., fig. 2., taf.
XIV) showing the positions of these step faults and their effect on
the various strata through which they cut. Fortunately, in this
neighbourhood the stratigraphical succession is well exposed and
the presence or absence of faults become matters of easy
determination. The sequence of beds from south to north is normal
and uninterrupted and our interpretation of the area is shown in
the accompanying sections (Plates <a href="#i19">XIX,</a> <a href=
"#i22">XXII,</a> and <a href="#fig04">fig. 4</a>). We have no
hesitation in saying that such faults as those shown on
Blanckenhorn’s section do not exist. Their insertion appears to be
the outcome of an error in the correlation of strata at the three
points Abshawai, Geziret el Qorn and Dimê. The bed capping the
island is not identical with that forming the plain to the north of
Dimê, although shown to be such on the section under
discussion.</p>

<p>In a later publication<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Blanckenhorn admits being
in error in his correlation of the different beds in the localities
in question and completely withdraws his former statements that the
depression owes its existence to fracture and subsidence. The
faults shown on his detailed section from Abshawai to Qasr el Sagha
are admitted to be non-existent and in this retraction we may
presumably include the remainder of the faults described by the
same author, as the evidence for them is of a still less
satisfactory nature.</p>

<p>In a wind-swept desert area like the Fayûm the slightest
dislocations are as a rule markedly obvious, and faults of any
magnitude could scarcely escape detection. Over the greater part of
the region every bed is laid bare on the surface and can be
minutely examined; while the marked irregularity of the escarpments
afford sections cut through the different series in every
direction. Some areas, however, are covered with superficial
deposits, which more or less effectually obscure the underlying
rocks; for instance, on the east side a large part of the central
floor is hidden by the cultivated alluvium and by the water of the
lake; in the south a considerable proportion of the floor of Wadi
Rayan is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> buried under
accumulations of blown sand; and again large areas on the north,
west, and south-west sides are obscured by a superficial covering
of loose gravel. But as already mentioned, there is no reason to
suppose that faults of any importance exist within the areas thus
partly obscured. The cultivated lands and the Birket el Qurûn do
not occupy low areas produced by faulting but, as shown above, owe
their positions entirely to the original northerly dip of the
strata and to subsequent erosion.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Numerous small
faults effects local.</span>We have already stated that small local
faults occur in various parts of the Fayûm and some of these may be
specially mentioned. The most important is about 10 kilometres
N.N.E. of Qasr el Sagha; the line of fault lies nearly north-west
and south-east, has a length of six or seven kilometres, and
affects both middle and upper Eocene beds; at its northern end the
fault passes into a fold before finally dying out. Some of the
Upper Eocene sandstones are hardened and silicified and form a
succession of black knobs along the line of disturbance. To the
south of these the axis of dislocation bends slightly eastwards and
takes the form of a sharp fold; further south it again becomes a
true fault, flanked by a line of highly tilted beds along its
south-west side. The effects of this fault are very marked locally
but entirely restricted to a limited area. The most important is
the breaking of the continuity of the escarpment of the Qasr el
Sagha series; the line of cliffs formed by those beds is a very
marked topographical feature and the fault in question causes a
lateral displacement of seven kilometres.</p>

<p class="cp2"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.—Fault near Qasr el
Sagha.</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Qasr el Sagha and westwards for a
considerable distance, small strike-faults are of common occurrence
in the beds of the Qasr el Sagha series. As a rule these faults do
not extend more than a few hundred metres in length, while the
down-throw seldom exceeds two or three metres and in almost every
case observed is to the north. The hade may be 65° or more. Fig. 1
shows an example near Qasr el Sagha. The most marked of these
strike faults is seen to the east of Garat el Esh; commencing a
little to the north-east of that hill it runs in a nearly due
easterly direction till it cuts the cliffs of the Qasr el Sagha
series after some five kilometres. Its down-throw is to the north
and never exceeds a few metres; this small throw is however
sufficient to cause a marked displacement of the highest bed of
limestone forming the dip-slope surface of the plateau at the
summit of the Middle Eocene beds.</p>

<p>At first sight it might be suspected that the very irregular
trend of the different escarpments throughout the Fayûm was
determined or influenced by fault lines; an extended examination of
the cliffs however gave negative results, with one exception; the
long narrow hill-mass to the north east of Gar el Gahannem is
bounded by faults on both sides and that on the west can be easily
traced for seven or eight kilometres northwards, and throughout its
length its influence on the topography is very conspicuous.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> geology of the
area<a id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class=
"fnanchor">[33]</a> under consideration is almost entirely
stratigraphical, the only igneous rocks being more or less local
lava flows. The sedimentary rocks of the district have yielded an
abundant fauna, both invertebrate and vertebrate; the latter is of
unique interest, including as it does a number of highly
interesting animal types quite new to science. An extended
examination in the field, and comparisons with the stratigraphical
succession in other parts of Egypt, checked by the determinations
of the fossil molluscan fauna, make it possible to form a very fair
estimate of the approximate age of the different rock-stages,
although this may necessarily be subject to modification when the
specific determinations of the entire collection of organic remains
have been completed, and the development of vertebrate life has
been correlated and compared with that in other parts of the
world.</p>

<p>The depression is cut out in a great series of sedimentary rocks
of Middle Eocene, Upper Eocene, and Oligocene age, and one of the
features of the stratigraphy of the region is the constancy of many
beds over wide areas. The dip of the beds throughout the area is
nearly due north and at a very low angle, averaging 2° or 3°, but
varying from 1° to 5°; this low dip is very constantly maintained
except when locally affected by small faults. The structural
geology and tectonics have already been discussed at some length in
the previous sections.</p>

<p>The oldest beds found in the depression are the clays, marls,
and limestones with <i>Nummulites gizehensis</i>, of Middle Eocene
age. These are succeeded by a group of white marly limestones and
gypseous clays, which largely underlie the cultivated alluvium of
the Fayûm. They are followed by a series consisting of clays,
sandstones, and calcareous grits, some beds of which are
characterized by the abundance of small nummulites and
<i>Operculina</i>. The latter series is followed by the uppermost
truly marine Eocene beds, a group of alternating clays, sandstones
and limestones, the “Qasr el Sagha Series” (or Carolia beds),
characterized by an abundant invertebrate and vertebrate fauna, and
equivalent to the Upper Mokattam beds of Cairo.</p>

<p>Above the Qasr el Sagha series, and well marked off from them
both lithologically and palæontologically, is found a great
thickness of variegated sands, sandstones, clays and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> marls, the “Fluvio-marine
Series” (Jebel el Qatrani beds), divided near the summit by one or
more thick intercalated lava sheets, the latter forming a
convenient junction line. This series of variegated beds is of
Upper Eocene—Lower Oligocene age.</p>

<p>No Miocene strata have been recognized within the area, but
further north, as at Mogara, Lower Miocene deposits occur;<a id=
"FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and it is probable that there is a continuous series of
lithologically similar beds from the summit of the Fayûm
escarpments (Lower Oligocene) to the Mogara Miocene.</p>

<p>The Pliocene is probably represented by the great terraces of
gravel—raised beaches—which are such a marked feature in the
geology of the district. Fossiliferous Pliocene deposits have also
been recorded from the south part of the area by
Schweinfurth.<a id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Pleistocene and Recent are abundantly represented by lacustrine
clays, both ancient and modern, alluvial land and blown sand, the
formation of which deposits is continuing at the present time.</p>

species, occur in remarkable profusion not only in the limestones
but often in the clays.</p>

<p>There is a considerable difference in thicknesses between the

with those of Schweinfurth, so that it is probable that Mayer-Eymar

<p>The beds of this series, consisting of gypseous clays, clayey
marls, and white marly limestones, are met with bordering the
cultivation on the east, west and north sides; they pass under the
alluvial soil of the cultivated land and are frequently seen in the
bottoms of canals, and especially in the deep ravines known as El
Bats, and El Wadi (Plates <a href="#i03">III</a> and <a href=
"#i05">V</a>). The relation of these beds to the Rayan series below
is well seen at the prominent outstanding hill Gar el Gehannem
(<a href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>); here the plain to the east and south
is formed of the uppermost member of the Wadi Rayan series, a
limestone full of <i>Nummulites gizehensis</i>. In the hill itself
the latter is directly overlain by gypseous and
glauconitic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> sandy
clays and marls, with hard intervening beds of yellowish, often
marly, limestone. The upper beds consist of alternating clays,
sandy limestone and sandstone, at the top being a thick bed of the
latter passing up gradually into the sandstones of the Birket el
Qurûn series. The following is the detailed section:—</p>

Ravine Beds.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The clays, marls, and limestones of the Ravine beds are
generally found to contain fairly numerous shell-impressions,
including <i>Nucularia</i> sp., <i>Leda</i> sp., <i>Cardita</i>
sp., <i>Corbula</i> aff. <i>pixidicula</i>, <i>Lucina</i> sp.,
<i>Oudardia ovalis</i>, Desh., <i>Tellina tenuistriata</i>,<a id=

numerous small fish-scales, and occasional large teeth of sharks;
while the skeletons of the toothed-whale <i>Zeuglodon Isis</i> are
fairly common, although usually in poor preservation.</p>

<p>In the ravine of El Bats, about one kilometre west of Sêla,
these beds (5-6 metres thick) are seen unconformably overlaid by 12
metres of false-bedded gypseous sands and clays passing up into the
superficial cultivated loam. The junction of these alluvial
deposits and the underlying Eocene is distinctly unconformable and
an intervening pebble-bed is occasionally present (<a href=
"#fig03">Fig 3</a>).</p>

<p>In the large ravine known as El Wadi, which traverses the west
side of the cultivation of the Fayûm, these beds are frequently
well exposed; their lithological characters remain very constant.
Here, as in El Bats, they are unconformably overlain by a varying
thickness of Pleistocene and Recent clays. Their surface, a plain
of subaerial denudation, represents the original floor of the
depression before the entry of the sediment-carrying water from the
Nile Valley through the Lahûn gap; its irregularity is seen in
<a href="#i05">Plate V.</a></p>

<p>The plain bordering the cultivation to the east of Sêla and
Rubiat likewise consists of these same white marls with
fish-scales, etc.; they pass regularly under the cultivated
land.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> Shaly marls,
gypseous clays, and chalky limestones of the same age are seen in,
and to the south of, the railway crossing the desert between Sêla
and Medum. Eastwards they stretch into the Nile Valley, being found
exposed along the desert-edge bordering the cultivation at Medum,
Nawamis and Masaret-Abusia.</p>

<p>The same beds are exposed immediately to the east of the village
of Sersena, midway between Sêla and Tamia. They are again well seen
in the ravine below the last named village, and forming the narrow
strip of the desert projecting into the cultivation as far as the
northern end of the Tamia lake; they also occur on the shore of the
latter at El Tuba, about 2 kilometres south of the village. At
Tamia their exposure measures 25 metres in thickness.</p>

<p>At various points along the north side of the Birket el Qurûn
exposures of this series occur, the beds forming the lower sloping
part of the cliffs overlooking the lake, as well as the base of the
island “Geziret el Qorn,” although only the upper beds are visible
above the water of the lake. Both here and along the northern shore
of the lake they are for the most part hidden by the high level
recent lacustrine clays, but where occasionally exposed their
identity is certain, the characteristic small brown fish-scales
being abundant, besides occasional teeth, with shell-impressions of
the different genera enumerated above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>At the western end
of the lake the Ravine beds form the lower part of the cliff as
well as the plain to the south; the underlying <i>Nummulites
gizehensis</i> limestone not being exposed. The series consists of
some 45 metres of white and grey shaly marls with harder bands of
siliceous limestone intercalated throughout, one of which usually
forms the uppermost bed. It is, in fact, the development in places
of one or other of these hard beds of limestone near the top of the
series that gives rise to the bold promontories, or horns, which
occur on the north side of the Birket el Qurûn.</p>

<p>The greater part of the marls and clays met with from 18·5 to
112·5 metres below the surface in the boring at Medinet el Fayûm in
all probability belong to the Ravine beds.</p>

<p>The maximum thickness of this series is 70 metres, measured at
Gar el Gehannem.</p>

<h4><a id="s10c"></a><em>C.</em>—<span class="bold">Birket el Qurun
Series</span> (<em>Operculina-Nummulite Beds</em>).</h4>

<p>The above designation is convenient and applicable to these
beds, which form the escarpment immediately overlooking the lake on
the north side throughout its length.</p>

<p>The group includes all the beds between those last described and
the well-marked Qasr el Sagha series, homotaxial with the Upper
Mokattam (the brown beds) of Jebel Mokattam, near Cairo. It thus
appears to be the equivalent of the upper part of the white beds
(quarried limestones) of the Mokattam section, although the
lithological characters are entirely different, the massive
limestones of Jebel Mokattam being represented in the Fayûm by an
arenaceous and argillaceous series, deposited probably in water of
far less depth. Where the different members of this series are well
exposed certain beds are found to be characterized by the abundance
of two foraminifera, the one a small thin-shelled <i>Operculina</i>
(<i>O. discoidea</i>)., and the other a small thick
nummulite.<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a> The tests of these foraminifera sometimes make
up entire bands of rock. In addition, the series includes certain
beds which at times become very fossiliferous, and contain a
well-preserved molluscan fauna.</p>

<p>The series is well seen in the desert separating the Fayûm from
the Nile Valley; on the south-east and east sides of the former;
along the northern boundary of the cultivation and the Birket el
Qurûn; and westwards in the cliffs to beyond the outlying hill-mass

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>In the north of
the Fayûm the series is characterized by the presence of one or
more very constant well-marked beds of hard calcareous sandstone,
which almost invariably weather into huge globular masses. These
masses should be regarded as huge weathered-out concretions, rather
than as water-rounded blocks, although no doubt in many cases their
roundness has been increased by the action of the waters of Lake
Moeris as the level of the latter gradually fell, and possibly
still earlier during the invasion of the Pliocene sea; from the
latter time also may date the millions of parallel vertical borings
with which these and other exposed rocks are often perforated. In
the various places where one of these beds forms the present
surface of the desert the concretions may be seen in different
stages of exposure, from the initial, where only just the tops are
laid bare, to the final stage where the globes are left completely
weathered out, as seen in the illustration (<a href="#i07">Plate
VII</a>). The appearance of the desert when covered for many square
kilometres with thousands of these blocks is more easily imagined
than described.</p>

<p>The lower beds of the Birket el Qurûn series form the island
Geziret el Qorn, and consist of clays and sandstones containing a
considerable number of organic remains. These beds were collected
from and examined by Schweinfurth<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in 1879, the mollusca
being subsequently described by Mayer-Eymar,<a id=

while the vertebrate remains, which included cetacean bones and
numerous fish-teeth, were submitted to Dames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>The cetacean
remains, belonging to the genus <i>Zeuglodon</i>, were described by
W. Dames,<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class=
"fnanchor">[48]</a> who compared them with the American species
<i>Z. macrospondylus</i> and <i>Z. brachyspondylus</i>, but did not
then consider them to represent a new species; in a later
publication,<a id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class=
"fnanchor">[49]</a> however, the same author described similar but
more complete remains, also collected by Schweinfurth (from beds
belonging to our Qasr el Sagha series), as a new species, <i>Z.
Osiris</i>. A considerable number of fish-remains from Geziret el
Qorn are also described in the earlier publication. Although the
difference in size of the bones of separate individuals was
considered by Dames to be sexual, it seems probable that there are
two distinct species of <i>Zeuglodon</i>, as the smaller type
appears to have a much greater upward range than the larger<a id=
"FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>;
both species, <i>Z. Osiris</i>, and <i>Z. Isis</i> occur in the
Birket el Qurûn series, and a very fine mandible of the larger was
obtained from these beds in the cliffs near the west end of the
lake.<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class=

the Birket el Qurûn series in this part of the Fayûm are
lithologically similar to those just described, consisting of
alternating clays and sandstones, about 37 metres thick. They are,
however, generally much richer in fossil remains, which are
likewise usually better preserved than in the lower beds. Some of
the brown sandstones of this series are literally crowded with
perfect examples of many of the typical mollusca; and further west,
near the end of the lake, foraminiferal bands again become
noticeable. Near Dimê the escarpment of these and the lower beds is
gentle and inconspicuous, but followed westwards it becomes a bold
precipitous cliff, increasing in height towards the western end of
the lake, where it is capped by the lower beds of the Qasr el Sagha

<p>In the cliffs west of the end of the lake the upper bed No. 9
continues highly fossiliferous and yields the most perfectly
preserved molluscan remains to be found in the Fayûm and probably
in Egypt.</p>

<p>A few kilometres east of the end of the lake a band of large
globular concretions occurs in the thick brown sandstone forming
the vertical face of the cliff. In many places the effect of
weathering of these rocks is of some interest, numerous
“earth-pillars” having been formed; these are largely the result of
the action of blown sand, assisted by rain, the concretions being
left capping pillars of brown sandstone, the sides of which are
sculptured by the wearing action of sand. The curious perforate or
cellular appearance which the weathered surfaces of this sandstone
assume after long exposure are particularly noticeable in this
neighbourhood and in the Zeuglodon Valley further west.</p>

<p>In the well-marked hill distant 17 kilometres to the north-east
of Gar el Gehannem, the soft fossiliferous sandstones of this
series are crowded with <i>Operculina</i>, <i>Nummulites</i>, and
many species of mollusca beautifully preserved.</p>

<p>At Gar el Gehannem the series is seen (<a href="#fig02">Fig.
2</a> and detailed section <a href="#Page_36">page 36</a>) forming
part of the slope of the hill, underlain by the Ravine beds, and
capped by part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Qasr el Sagha series. It here consists of yellow sandstones divided
by a bed of clay; the sandstones are often crowded with nummulites
(of two species); also <i>Operculina</i> (<i>discoidea?</i>),
echinids, <i>Balanus</i> sp., <i>Ostrea Reili</i>, <i>O.
Fraasi</i>, <i>Carolia placunoides</i>, and species of
<i>Pecten</i>, <i>Pinna</i>, <i>Cardita</i>, <i>Teredo</i>,
<i>Turritella</i>, and <i>Cerithium</i>.</p>

<p>In the Zeuglodon Valley, 12 kilometres W.S.W. of Gar el
Gehannem, the brown sandstones of the Birket el Qurûn series are
divided by a narrow band of fine-bedded grey clay. Most of the
fantastically shaped hills on the south-west slope of the valley
are carved out of the lower division of the sandstone. The
concretionary beds of the Birket el-Qurûn series are not developed
in this neighbourhood. Remains of <i>Zeuglodon</i> of both species
(<i>Z. Osiris</i> and <i>Z. Isis</i>) are remarkably abundant and
the skeletons of these cetaceans may be found in every stage of
weathering. The larger species, <i>Z. Isis</i>, is the more common,
and series of vertebrae, twelve to fifteen in number, can
frequently be counted in situ. The remains are most abundant
enclosed in the hard brown nodular bands of the series but in such
cases it is almost impossible to extract specimens of any value. In
one instance an almost complete skull of <i>Z. Isis</i>, measuring
116 cm. in length, was found enclosed in a large block of the
nodular rock.<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class=
"fnanchor">[57]</a> Bones are frequently to be observed protruding
from the wind-worn sides of the small hills, while those portions
of the skeleton already weathered out litter the ground below.
Exposed they break up with rapidity, although where the enclosing
rock is softer than the bone itself, parts of the skeleton
beautifully preserved and perfectly free from matrix may sometimes
be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>The molluscan
fauna is represented by very large numbers of pseudomorphs in
sulphate of strontium (celestine) of the genera <i>Lucina</i>,
<i>Turritella</i>, <i>Fusus</i> and <i>Nautilus</i>, the profusion
of individuals of a species of the latter being very marked. In the
case of lamellibranchs the radiating bundles of crystals of
celestine are seen to originate from a point placed centrally on
one of the valves, so that on this side (of a slightly weathered
example) a radiating mass of crystals is seen, while on the other
appear numerous contiguous circular areas, representing the
terminal ends of the bundles of crystalline fibres or needles.
Apart from the quantities of organic pseudomorphs, masses of
crystalline celestine occur in the sandstones throughout the
valley, and altogether the quantity of sulphate of strontium
present must be very great. The gigantic oysters and other fossils
which occur in some of the overlying higher beds, and the numerous
individuals of nummulites in the sandstone itself, never seem to be
replaced by celestine.</p>

<p>Nummulites of two species are very abundant in some bands and
the presence in the Zeuglodon Valley of occasional individuals of
the large <i>N. gizehensis</i> shows that in favourable localities
this species persisted throughout the time represented by the
deposition of the Ravine beds and ranged upward into the basal
members of the Birket el Qurûn series.</p>

<p>In the higher hills within the valley, and in the hill-mass on
the south side, the yellow sandstones of the Birket el Qurûn series
pass up into the basal members of the Qasr el Sagha series. In
their upper limits the sandstones become very nummulitic in places
and at the top bands made up of <i>Carolia</i> and <i>Ostrea</i>
occur. Above these, in the basal members of the Qasr el Sagha
series, huge oysters and finely preserved specimens of <i>Qerunia
cornuta</i> are conspicuous.</p>

<p>The dip in the valley is 2° north.</p>

<p>The southern face of the hill-mass lying immediately to the
south of the Zeuglodon Valley is an almost sheer cliff of over 100
metres, descending to the silt covered basin below which has
already been noticed (<a href="#Page_23">page 23</a>). On this
escarpment the hard nodular marly limestones of the Ravine beds are
seen near the base, overlain by a mass of grey shaly gypseous beds;
above, forming as a rule a vertical wall of rock, lies the hard
massive brown sandstone of the Birket el Qurûn series, here
undivided by clays; at the top, highly fossiliferous alternating
clays and limestones are found forming the summit of the hills.</p>

<p>The exact junction between the Birket el Qurûn series and the
overlying Qasr el Sagha beds is naturally perfectly arbitrary, many
of the fossils being common to both groups. <i>Carolia
placunoides</i>, which is perhaps the most abundant fossil in the
Qasr el Sagha series, is sometimes very common in the upper beds of
the underlying group, and, as shown before, is common enough in the
still lower <i>Nummulites gizehensis</i> beds of Wadi Rayan. So
that, though this fossil itself is no criterion, its relative
abundance in the upper series justifies those beds being called the
“Carolia beds,” the additional name of the Qasr el Sagha series
being taken from the old ruin of that name where these beds are
fully seen.</p>

<p class="cp1">MIDDLE EOCENE ESCARPMENT (QASR EL SAGHA SERIES) 12
KILOM. WEST OF QASR EL SAGHA.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<h4><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span><a id=
"s10d"></a><em>D.</em>—<span class="bold">Qasr el Sagha
Series</span> (<em>Carolia Beds</em>).</h4>

<p>This division is strikingly developed in the north of the Fayûm,
where it forms a bold escarpment of great length, consisting of an
alternating series of very fossiliferous clays and limestones, with
sands and sandstone in the upper beds, of a total thickness of 175
metres.</p>

<p>This series is the equivalent of the well known Upper Mokattam
beds of Jebel Mokattam, immediately to the east of Cairo. The
cliffs of this hill are among the best known in Egypt and have been
studied by many geologists, including Zittel, Schweinfurth,
Mayer-Eymar, etc.; these authors have classified the whole of the
Upper Mokattam of Cairo as equivalent to the Upper Parisian (Middle
Eocene) of Western Europe. The series is far better developed in
the Fayûm than at Jebel Mokattam, where the total thickness is only
some 70 to 80 metres.</p>

<p>In consequence of the discovery in these beds of a highly
interesting vertebrate fauna, including land animals, the series
becomes of the greatest importance. As already mentioned, as long
ago as 1879, Schweinfurth, during a journey across the Fayûm,
obtained remains of <i>Zeuglodon</i> in the underlying series from
the island in the Birket el Qurûn. Subsequently<a id=
"FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
he obtained additional remains of the same cetacean in a violet
marl belonging to the present series, from a locality 12½
kilometres west of Qasr el Sagha<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>; these remains, as already
mentioned, were described by Dames as <i>Z. Osiris</i>. Since then
important finds of land and marine mammals and reptiles have been
made in different beds of this series; these will be referred to
later.</p>

<p>The outcrop of the Qasr el Sagha series occupies a large part of
the northern desert of the Fayûm. The beds are, however, best seen
in the cliffs about 8 kilometres north of the Birket el Qurûn,
where they form a steep double escarpment, running east and west,
nearly parallel to the northern shore of the lake. The dip of the
series being northward at a very low angle, and the upward slope of
the ground being in the same direction, this cliff dies out a few
kilometres north-east of Qasr el Sagha. A little further north,
however, a N.W.-S.E. fold and fault again exposes nearly the whole
of the beds of the series, forming prominent cliffs as before.</p>

<p>In the conspicuous hill 17½ kilometres 28° N. of E. (magnetic)
of Tamia the series consists of innumerable alternations of clays
and sandy limestone. The calcareous beds nearly always contain
numerous examples of <i>Carolia placunoides</i>, <i>Ostrea</i> and
<i>Turritella</i> of several species, but other well-preserved
fossils are rare. The exposed beds here have a thickness of about
55 metres, and are underlain by the Birket el Qurûn beds with a
well-marked band of concretionary sandstone, the thickness of the
two series together being 127 metres. The upper beds of the former
series are not here exposed, the top of the hill being<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> formed of well-rounded flint and
quartz pebbles embedded in a base of finely crystalline gypsum (2
metres thick), a deposit of Pleistocene times.</p>

<p>To the north of Tamia a large area of desert is occupied by the
beds of this series; the district has the character of an
undulating plain with occasional groups of hills and low irregular
escarpments. At the groups of hills 12 kilometres N.N.E. of Tamia,
and just to the east of Garat el Faras, the Qasr el Sagha beds are
found to consist as usual of an alternating series of sands,
sandstones, clays, marls and limestones, with numerous individuals
of <i>Ostrea</i>, <i>Carolia</i> and <i>Turritella</i>, besides
vertebræ, teeth and spines of large fish.</p>

<p>We may pass now to the locality where this series shows its best
development and exposure, the beds being all concentrated in one
bold escarpment, generally divisible into an upper and a lower
cliff. These cliffs overlook the Birket el Qurûn, although distant
usually about 8 kilometres, being separated from the lower
escarpment of the Birket el Qurûn series (immediately above the
lake shore) by a broad plain, the surface of which is usually the
dip-slope of a hard bed of sandstone. From Qasr el Sagha (6½
kilometres N.N.E. of Dimê) these cliffs trend westward, keeping
approximately the same distance from the north shore of the lake;
they have been followed and mapped for a distance of 70 kilometres
to a point 13 kilometres N.N.W. of Gar el Gehannem, whence they
could be seen still trending in a direction slightly south of west
(see <a href="#i17">Plate XVII</a>).</p>

<p>Small faults are of frequent occurrence along these escarpments,
but are not of other than local interest; they almost invariably
have their downthrow to the north, and it seldom exceeds a few
metres. <a href="#fig05">Fig. 5</a> shows a section through one of
these faults near Qasr el Sagha.</p>

<p>The following detailed section (<a href="#i23">Plate XXIII</a>)
will show the character of the beds forming this division. As might
be expected in such a series, although the calcareous bands are
fairly constant, there is a continuous change of character among
the sandy and clayey sediments from point to point; the
false-bedding is in places very striking.</p>

<p>The main part of the section was measured 3½ kilometres
north-east of Qasr el Sagha, but the lower beds not being exposed
at that point, they were added from the cliffs at the ruin itself.
The total thickness is 154 metres.</p>

<p>The chief divisions of the series remain fairly constant and can
be recognized and followed for many kilometres westwards.<a id=
"FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
The lower beds form the summits of Gar el Gehannem and the
neighbouring hills (see <a href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> and section
<a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>), the upper beds of the series being
exposed in the higher escarpments to the north.</p>

<p>Although vertebrate remains are more common on some
horizons<a id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class=
"fnanchor">[62]</a> than on others, they are occasionally met with
in most of the beds. The most prolific bone horizon is, however,
about half-way down, i.e., those beds numbered 16 and 17 in the
above section; bed 7 also yielded a number of remains. At the point
where the upper part of the section was measured, 3½ kilometres
north-east of Qasr el Sagha, the beds 16 and 17 yielded a
considerable number of land-animal remains, all of which occurred
within a fairly confined space, suggesting that they had been
carried out from the land to this point by a strong river-current
and deposited when the latter became too feeble to carry them
further out to sea. The same beds were also examined in the faulted
bay 8 kilometres to the north, but no bones, or at most a very
occasional fragment or two, were obtained here. This is easily
explained by the greater distance of this locality from the
land-mass to the south. Westwards the same beds were always found
more or less bone-bearing, isolated detached mandibles, limb-bones
and vertebræ of <i>Mœritherium</i>, being of frequent occurrence,
although no such complete remains were found as those from near
Qasr el Sagha. Reptilian and fish<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_53">[53]</span> bones are very widespread throughout the
area. An extensive and detailed examination of these beds over a
large area can hardly fail to yield important results, as other
localities where skeleton-carrying currents came out from the land
would very likely be discovered.</p>

<p>That the Qasr el Sagha series was deposited in fairly shallow
water at no great distance from land seems certain, not only from
the general lithological character of the beds but from the number
of land-animal remains and the frequency of river and
shore-frequenting whales, dugongs, crocodiles and turtles. The
clays, moreover, are found to abound with impressions of plants,
and in some cases are highly lignitic, being made up of compressed
masses of vegetation including solid twigs, now found in a state
more resembling charcoal than ordinary dense lignites; some bands
approximate to an impure brown coal. In certain beds of the series
further to the west, very thin seams of true coal occur; they were,
however, never seen to exceed one or two millimetres. The
intercalated bands of limestone are generally impure and do not
indicate any great conditions of depth, but only rather a temporary
cessation in the supply of sand and clay. Corals, moreover, abound
along many horizons.</p>

<h4 class="space-above1"><a id="s11e"></a><em>E.</em>—<span class=
"bold">Fluvio-Marine Series</span> (<em>Jebel el Qatrani
Beds</em>).</h4>

<p>Throughout the north of the Fayûm depression the Qasr el Sagha
beds, forming the uppermost Middle Eocene, are followed by an
unique series<a id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class=
"fnanchor">[63]</a> of variegated<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> sands and sandstones, with
alternating beds of clay and clayey marl. The ever-recurring bands
of limestone, so common to the underlying marine beds, have now
almost completely disappeared, being represented by only an
occasional bed of calcareous grit, marl, or thin band of limestone.
In the upper part of the series occurs a horizontal sheet of
basalt,<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class=
"fnanchor">[65]</a> in all probability contemporaneously
interbedded; this forms a convenient datum line and may perhaps be
provisionally taken as an arbitrary junction between the Eocene and
Oligocene. Although as a rule remarkably barren of organic remains,
certain bands, especially in the upper part, yield numerous
individuals of a few species of mollusca, including <i>Lucina</i>,
<i>Arca</i>, <i>Mutela</i>, <i>Spatha</i>, <i>Unio</i>,
<i>Lanistes</i>, <i>Turritella</i>, <i>Melania</i>,
<i>Potamides</i>, <i>Cerithium</i> and <i>Pleurotoma</i>. From such
an assemblage we may without doubt conclude that the conditions
under which the series was deposited were estuarine or
fluvio-marine, and this is further proved by the non-marine
lithological character of the beds. The enormous quantities of
silicified wood which occur in certain beds, in the shape of
hundreds of trees of great length and girth, together with the
numerous remains of land-animals, crocodiles, tortoises and
turtles, indicate that rivers of considerable size emerged from the
land to the south, the coast-line of which was probably<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> not far distant. In fact the
retreat of the sea, which as already mentioned, had probably
already begun in Middle Eocene times, was now still further
continued, although the cause of this was apparently not so much
due to elevation of the land as to the continued deposition of
sediment from south to north beyond the land-shore. We may in fact
regard the series as a huge delta deposit in an area of local
depression, in which the great accumulation of sediment brought
down from the land continually caused the gradual retreat of the
sea to the north.</p>

<p>The same conditions would even appear to have continued on to
Pliocene times, as from the Fayûm northwards stretches an immense
plain of lithologically similar rocks, evidently accumulated under
similar conditions, and which appear to contain newer and newer
faunas from south to north. Thus, while in the Fayûm the remains
are of Middle and Upper Eocene and Lower Oligocene age, when the
latitude of Mogara is reached, some 70 kilometres further north, a
fauna distinctly Lower Miocene in aspect occurs; further north
again, as at Wadi Natrûn, Pliocene remains are abundant. We may
hope therefore that this otherwise barren desert, when carefully
and systematically explored, will yield us a continuous record of
the vertebrate life of the northern part of the African continent
from Eocene to Pleistocene times.</p>

<p>In the Fayûm, over a length of 80 to 90 kilometres, the basal
beds of the Fluvio-marine series, at a height of only a few metres
above the top of the Qasr el Sagha series, are frequently found to
contain the remains of land-animals, often in sufficient quantities
to form in places a true “bone-bed.” Besides land-mammals, remains
of large tortoises, turtles and crocodiles, are very common, some
of the latter being identical with those of the Qasr el Sagha
series below. Chelonian and crocodilian remains are to be found on
various horizons, but so far none but fragmentary mammal remains
have been observed in the higher parts of the series. It is
interesting to note that the bones in these beds appear to be most
common near the accumulations of fossil trees, thus suggesting that
they were floated out from the land at the same time and by the
same river-currents. The porous character of the sands and
sandstones of this group has resulted in the remains not being in
nearly so hard or durable a condition, except when coated with
ferruginous sand, as those in the series below, although the actual
state of preservation is even more perfect.</p>

<p>Analysis shows that these bones, with the exception of the loss
of all organic matter, have undergone very little change. A sample
examined by Mr. Lucas was taken from a typically preserved pelvis
of <i>Arsinoitherium</i> and gave the following result:—</p>

<p>It is curious that these Eocene bones should have so completely
preserved their original composition considering the almost
universal silicification of the trees deposited in the same
beds.</p>

<p>Most frequently the vertebrate remains are found in an
unconsolidated false-bedded clean quartz sand, the grains of which
are semi-rounded or angular; in some layers the sand is very coarse
and polished, and mixed with fine gravel. These deposits of sand,
apparently brought down by river floods, are not continuous along
any particular horizon, but are intercalated here and there in the
ordinary sandstones, clays and marls of the series; they occur
chiefly, however, as local lenticular masses along a more or less
constant horizon near the base of the series. The bone-remains are
not absolutely confined to these deposits of river-sand, but like
the silicified trees are far more common in them than elsewhere.
Scattered mammal bones occur in the lower clays, marls, and hard
concretionary sandstones, while the remains of aquatic animals,
such as turtles and crocodiles, may be found almost anywhere.</p>

<p>From an examination of the series in the field, there is no
doubt that, in at least the centre of the area, the deposition of
the lowest beds was continuous with those of the Qasr el Sagha
(Middle Eocene) series below. Followed away from the centre (i.e.
the district round Widan el Faras, the eastern extremity of Jebel
el Qatrani) the series gradually thins out, and eastwards, at Elwat
Hialla, some 23 kilometres north of Tamia, has a thickness of only
40 metres, the basal beds being apparently laid on to a bed of
limestone of the Qasr el Sagha series about the horizon of Bed 12
in <a href="#i23">Section XXIII.</a> The junction here is
apparently one of perfect conformity as far as the individual beds
go, and the peculiar sequence does not seem to be due to ordinary
overlap; it appears as if the change from marine to estuarine
conditions had set in earlier here than further to the west, with
the result that the upper Qasr el Sagha beds are wanting. Moreover,
the accumulation of estuarine beds went on so slowly in this
locality that the series does not attain to nearly its normal
thickness, while further east it dies out altogether. The slight
dip to the north is identical in both series, their lithological
characters being, however, very different.</p>

<p>Although the Qasr el Sagha series contains numerous bands of
clay and sandstone, the continual recurrence of thick beds of
limestone at once gives it a distinguishing feature from the group
under discussion; the latter is in fact characterized by the
highly-coloured sandy, and to less extent clayey, character of its
beds. While the Middle Eocene is essentially marine, the succeeding
formation marks the retreat of the sea and the incoming of
estuarine and brackish water conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Before discussing
the age of the Fluvio-marine series it will be well to describe its
development in the field. The beds of the complex are throughout
the district always found following on above the Qasr el Sagha
beds, although their thickness varies considerably, as might be
expected in a series of this nature. The most easterly locality to
which the formation was mapped is the scarp 23 kilometres due north
of Tamia, known as Elwat Hialla. Here the beds form a separate
escarpment, consisting of only about 40 metres of sands and
sandstone grit (sometimes silicified) with pieces of silicified
wood: some of the beds of sandstone have a concretionary stem-like
weathering. From this point these beds extend westwards far beyond
the western end of the lake, always forming the highest escarpments
of the Fayûm depression. A kilometre or two from our most easterly
point the first basalt sheets are seen, and these, preserving the
same level as far as can be observed, continue some 60 kilometres
further west, to a point nearly due north of the western end of the
Birket el Qurûn. The series, only 40 metres thick at the eastern
end, gradually thickens as it is followed westward, until it
reaches its maximum development in the cliffs of Jebel el Qatrani,
north-west of the temple of Qasr el Sagha, where a thickness of
some 210 metres is attained.</p>

<p>Just 29 kilometres N.N.E. of Tamia (6 kilometres N.W. of the
prominent western scarp of Elwat Hialla), a long hill offers a good
section of these beds, which consist of a variegated group of green
sands, red clays, coarse sandstones, red and yellow sand and
sandstone, etc., capped by a band of hard impure yellowish
limestone with numerous enclosed sand-grains (calcareous grit).
Near the same place is an interbedded sheet of basalt, which is
sometimes followed by another band of impure limestone and the
latter by false-bedded sandstone. Huge logs of weathered-out
silicified trees are seen strewn about.</p>

<p>The following is a detailed section of the series, measured from
a point 3½ kilometres W.N.W. of Elwat Hialla, and about 28
kilometres N.N.W. of Tamia, to the top of the escarpment 4
kilometres further north:—</p>

<p>A little further west, at a point 25 kilometres north of the
eastern end of the Birket el Qurûn, thick beds of white coarse
sandstone form the upper part of the escarpment. Below comes a bed
of yellowish impure limestone and below this an interbedded sheet
of basalt 21 metres thick, underlaid by more white sandstone.</p>

<p>The series has almost always a constant dip of two or three
degrees to the north. Silicified trees are very commonly found
strewn over the surface both near the base and high up in the
series.</p>

<p>At a point about 14 kilometres north of Qasr el Sagha definite
organic remains other than bone-fragments were for the first time
met with in the series. Here a fragment of ochreous-coloured grit
containing numerous specimens of a small <i>Melania</i> was picked
up and similar rocks were afterwards found <em>in situ</em>.
Calcareous grits and impure limestones occurred at the same spot,
and one of the harder more compact bands of limestone was found to
contain casts of <i>Cerithium</i>.</p>

<p>Also at a point 9 kilometres north of Qasr el Sagha hard grey
limestones, generally compact and cherty, and sometimes
semi-crystalline, are present, containing casts of
<i>Melania</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
frequently filled with calcite. These overlie variegated
sandstones, and occur at about 40 metres below the basalt near the
top of the escarpment.</p>

<p>Blanckenhorn has determined my fossils from these localities as
follows:—</p>

<p><i>Melania</i> nov. sp., allied to <i>M. Nysti</i> of the
Oligocene.</p>

<p><i>Potamides scalaroides</i>, Desh., an important guiding form
of the Middle Beauchamp Sands of the Paris Basin, and thus Upper
Eocene.</p>

<p><i>Potamides tristriatus</i>, Lam., of the Parisian
(<i>Cerithium crispum</i>, Desh.,) is nearly related to the
frequent Middle and Upper Eocene <i>C. perditum</i>, Bay, between
which, according to Cossmann, transitions exist.</p>

<p><i>Cerithium tiarella</i>, Desh., of the Middle and Upper
Eocene, but more especially in the latter.</p>

<p>Blanckenhorn considers these determinations as certain, and thus
marking the complex as Upper Eocene, on the level of the “Beauchamp
Sands” of the Paris Basin, and consequently of the Lower Headon
Hill beds and Barton Clay of the South of England.</p>

<p>The following section was measured from the base of the series,
2½ kilometres N.N.W. of Qasr el Sagha, to the summit of the
escarpments, 2 kilometres N.N.W. of Widan el Faras. The series has
its maximum thickness at this point.</p>

<p>The specimens collected from Bed 15, on about the same horizon
as the fossils mentioned from the locality 14 kilometres north of
Qasr el Sagha, were examined by Blanckenhorn, who has published the
following notice of them:—</p>

<p>“I should first mention the fresh-water shells found by Beadnell
in brown sandstone 1 kilometre north of Camp 19 (i.e. at Widan el
Faras), which, in the absence of special literature on the
Palaeogene fresh-water shells of North Africa and nearer Asia, I
have compared with the fauna of to-day, in which I was most kindly
helped by Professor v. Martens, Director of the Conchological
Collection of the Natural History Museum. The greater number of the
forms have a distinctly tropical, and more especially Central
African, character.</p>

<p><i>Unio</i> sp., small, related to the recent <i>U.
Nyassænsis</i> of Lake Nyassa.</p>

<p><i>Unio</i>, related to <i>U. Homsensis</i><a id=
"FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Lea, from Syria, and <i>U. Bonneaudi</i> from Cochin China, with
many radial folds behind the umbo which run obliquely from the
blunt edge backwards towards the hinge-border.</p>

<p><i>Unio</i>, related to <i>U. teretiusculus</i>, Phil.
(<i>Caillaudi</i>, Fer., <i>lithophagus</i>, Ziegli.) of the
Nile.</p>

<p><i>Pseudodon?</i> sp.</p>

<p><i>Mutela</i> (a genus of tropical Africa) sp., long, with a
straight finely-toothed hinge-border which very much recalls that
of <i>Barbatia</i> (a sub-genus of <i>Arca</i>).</p>

<p><i>Spatha</i> sp. related to <i>S. dahomeyensis</i> and <i>S.
Droueti</i> of Assinia in West Africa.</p>

<p><i>Lanistes carinatus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> scarcely distinguishable
from the Nile form.</p>

<p>The <i>Melania</i> occurring in mass in the uppermost calcareous
bed appears to be a new species<a id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> whose nearest relation
must in any case be <i>M. Nysti</i> of the Oligocene, not <i>M.
muricata</i> of the Eocene, amongst forms at present known.</p>

<p><i>Turritella angulata</i>, Sow. A marine form, occurring below
the basalt and indubitably this species, as it is well preserved
and easily determined<a id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; <i>T. angulata</i> ranges from the
Middle Eocene to the Lower Oligocene of the East and occurs in the
Upper Mokattam of Syria.”</p>

<p>From Widan el Faras the series continues westwards, forming
several escarpments, the uppermost that of Jebel el Qatrani, and
maintaining the same general characters. The tripartite character
of the series, already noticeable between Qasr el Sagha and Widan
el Faras (see foregoing section) becomes still more marked. The
lowest division is very<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_61">[61]</span> largely composed of fluviatile sands and
sandstones, frequently coarse-grained and usually markedly
current-bedded, divided by clays and containing an abundance of
silicified trees and quantities of vertebrate remains. These soft
beds, some 60 metres in thickness, have as a rule an extensive
outcrop, forming an undulating plain averaging two or three
kilometres in width. They are overlaid by some 17 metres of harder
dark red sandstones, which invariably form a well-marked escarpment
capped by a very constant two or three metres band of hard white or
pinkish calcareous grit. This grit varies in composition,
frequently passing into a marl; and one of the characteristics of
this and the underlying red beds is the abundance of nodular masses
of calcite and gypsum. In some localities, as for instance 3
kilometres W.N.W. of Qasr el Sagha, numerous spherical nodules of
beekitic chalcedony occur in the beds of this division, and some of
these when broken are found to be geodes lined with beautiful
crystals of quartz and calcite.</p>

<p>The next division consists of some 60 metres of alternating
sandstones and clays with occasional thin calcareous bands in the
upper part, and capped by a well-marked hard cherty limestone,
frequently passing into a dense tabular chert or flint. This
exceptionally hard band generally forms a dip-slope plain of some
width, before the softer basal members of the third and highest
division overlie it. The siliceous bed caps many of the most
notable hills in the district; among others may be mentioned the
big isolated hill 9 kilometres north-west of Garat el Esh, and the
hills five kilometres N.N.E. of the same point. This is the only
horizon throughout the Eocene succession of the Fayûm on which an
abundance of flint is met with; that it was well known and
exploited in early times is evident from the old pits met with on
the summits of the hills overlooking the main bone-pits, a few
kilometres north of Garat el Esh. As no worked flints were noticed
round the workings it is probable that the material was excavated
and carried away to the borders of the lake, there to be fashioned
into the harpoons, saws and other implements which are so commonly
found scattered at the present day near the margin of the old lake
site.</p>

<p>The uppermost division of the Fluvio-marine series consists of
over 100 metres of variegated sediments and forms the escarpment of
Jebel el Qatrani itself, capped by the conspicuous band of hard
black basalt, which is itself overlain by a further 20 metres of
similar sediments. The basalt has a thickness of over 20 metres in

<p class="cp1">SILICIFIED TREES OF FLUVIO-MARINE SERIES, 4½
KILOMETRES NORTH OF QASR EL SAGHA.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>In some localities
pebbly bands occur in the sandstone-grits, especially in some of
the beds above the basalt: the pebbles are mostly quartz or flint,
subangular or rounded, the layer averaging perhaps two cm. in
diameter, although occasional specimens three or four times that
size are met with. Silicified trees of two distinct types<a id=
"FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
occur, and they are met with chiefly on two horizons; usually large
numbers of trees occur together, completely covering the surface in
places; they lie as a rule scattered about in every direction,
although occasionally a large proportion may show considerable
parallelism of deposition, as if arranged by the direction of the
current which floated them to the spot. They always occur in a
horizontal position or parallel to the dip of the bed, and it seems
quite certain that none of them ever grew near where they are now
found. The trees never bear attached branches, the latter having
always been broken off at or near the point of junction with the
trunk, where the scars are often plainly seen; this points to the
trees having been drifted a considerable distance. Many trees over
25 metres<a id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class=
"fnanchor">[76]</a> in length have been met with, but this by no
means represents the original height, as the trunks have lost
considerably in length during transport to their present
localities. Although, as a rule, found completely weathered-out and
exposed on the surface, in numerous localities these silicified
trees are to be observed firmly embedded in the sandstones in which
they were deposited, many being met with in our excavations for
bones.</p>

<p>As the Fluvio-marine series is followed westwards from the
central part of the area, the different divisions become more and
more attenuated and the outcrops more and more obscured by
superficial gravel. North-west of the Zeuglodon Valley an
escarpment capped by a conspicuous bed of white calcareous grit
occurs and perhaps represents the lower beds of the series. The
higher are lost on the gravelly undulating plateau above.</p>

<h4><a id="s11f"></a><em>F.</em>—<span class="bold">Age of the
“Fluvio-Marine Series”.</span></h4>

<p>The beds in question being as a whole remarkably
unfossiliferous, a determination of their exact age on
palaeontological grounds is an undertaking of some difficulty. The
series, however, in certain beds is very rich in vertebrate
remains; a considerable number of new and important forms have
already been obtained and further additions are probable. Until the
survey of the area in 1898 it appears that the only fossils
obtained from these rocks were a few casts and badly-preserved
specimens of mollusca from the highest beds above the basalt,
collected by one or two observers from localities between the
summit of the Fayûm escarpments and the Pyramids of Giza.</p>

<p>The Rohlfs Expedition did not visit this part of Egypt, and
Zittel<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a> tabulated the beds, which he called the
“Schichten von Birket el Qurûn” as doubtfully Oligocene; probably
the beds referred to are those of the island Geziret el Qorn,
which, as already mentioned,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_64">[64]</span> belong to the lower division of the Birket el
Qurûn series, and are therefore of Middle Eocene age.
Mayer-Eymar<a id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class=
"fnanchor">[78]</a> states that he was able to subdivide the series
under discussion into Upper and Lower Ligurian and Lower Tongrian.
Schweinfurth<a id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class=
"fnanchor">[79]</a> considered the series as Miocene, comparing
them with the lithologically similar <i>Scutella</i> beds of Der el
Beda to the east of Cairo. Blanckenhorn, on the evidence of the
writer’s fossil collections, states, as already mentioned, that the
upper part is certainly to be regarded as Lower Oligocene and the
lower part as Upper Eocene.</p>

<p>First as to the stratigraphical position of the series. There is
no doubt that the lowest beds of the group were deposited (at any
rate in the central part of the area) in practical continuity with
the Qasr el Sagha series, which, as shown, is certainly of Middle
Eocene age. A great change in the lithology of the beds, however,
makes the junction a perfectly natural one. We pass from a truly
marine series into an estuarine or fluvio-marine set of beds, and
such a change near the summit of the Eocene is not an uncommon one
in some parts of Europe. The stratigraphical position in the field,
therefore, favours an Upper Eocene age for the lower beds. The dip
being northwards, newer and newer beds are met with from south to
north on the great undulating, but more or less level, desert north
of the escarpment summit. The occurrence of Lower Miocene beds at
Mogara, some 100 kilometres north or north-west, also points to a
somewhat younger, or Oligocene, age for the underlying beds, (i.e.,
those between the Fayûm escarpment and Mogara). The actual
relations, however, of the beds in the two localities have not yet
been determined, but it is probable younger beds are continually
met with from south to north.</p>

<p>Until the entire collection of fossils has been examined and
determined, it is somewhat premature to attempt to fix the age of
the series on palaeontological grounds. Up to the present the
foregoing lists show the species which have been provisionally or
finally determined. Some of these appear to be identical with
species which have been recorded from Upper Eocene deposits of
Europe, such as <i>Potamides scalaroides</i>, <i>P. tiarella</i>,
while others, such as <i>Melania</i> cf. <i>Nysti</i>, <i>Natica
crassatina</i> (found below the basalt in the so-called Sandberger
Hills north-east of the Fayûm escarpment), are typically Lower
Oligocene. Other forms, such as <i>Turritella angulata</i>, are
common to both Eocene and Oligocene elsewhere.</p>

<p>If Blanckenhorn’s determinations of these forms are confirmed,
we may regard the upper beds, i.e., those immediately above the
basalt, as undoubtedly of Lower Oligocene age. The beds below the
basalt mark the transition from the Eocene to Oligocene, while the
base of the series, so far unfossiliferous as far as molluscan
remains are concerned, must be regarded as of Upper Eocene
(Bartonian) age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>We may hope that
when the important vertebrate fauna occurring chiefly in the basal
part of the series has been thoroughly exploited, and the remains
systematically determined, confirmatory evidence will be obtained.
At present the only forms described and determined, beyond pointing
to a pre-Miocene age, do not indicate any definite horizon.
Probably most of the animals will prove to be new, and although on
that account more interesting from one point of view, will probably
not assist us greatly in the exact determination of the age of the
beds in question.</p>

<h4><a id="s11g"></a><em>G.</em>—<span class="bold">The Position of
the Land-mass from which the Mammal Remains were
Derived.</span></h4>

<p>The existence of remains of land animals throughout the larger
part of the Qasr el Sagha series and in still greater quantity in
the basal beds of the overlying Fluvio-marine series, and
occasionally in the highest beds also, points to the presence of
continental land within no great distance of the area in which
these deposits were laid down. That the animal-remains were carried
out from the land by river currents is almost certain, and although
in some cases such currents are known to persist to great distances
from their points of emergence, it seems probable from the quantity
and mode of distribution that the Fayûm bones were deposited within
a moderate distance of land. Moreover, the silicified trees, by
which the bones are so often accompanied, occur together in very
great quantities, and we should imagine that the individual trees
would have been far more scattered if they had been floated to
considerable distances from land. On the other hand the fact that
among the hundreds of trees examined, in no single case were
branches found attached to the trunk, points to the conclusion that
these trees had travelled great distances; probably the branches
were lost during their river journey, from constant jamming
together of a great number in a more or less constricted space, and
not after they had left the river mouth.</p>

<p>The exact position of this land-mass is a highly interesting and
important question. There is no reason to suppose that land of any
extent occurred to the north, except possibly an occasional island,
such as that of the Cretaceous massif of Abu Roash,<a id=
"FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
west of Cairo, which probably formed an island in the sea at that
time; without doubt the great Eocene sea which covered the area
stretched northwards, and was continuous with that in which the
southern European deposits of this period were laid down. To the
west also there was certainly no land-mass within approximate
distances. Eastwards, possibly part of the Red Sea Hills igneous
range may have formed a restricted land-area, but even this is not
probable; in fact, it seems certain that we must look to the south
for the nearest land of any extent. In supposing the land lay in
this direction we are confronted at the outset with the fact that
the Lower Eocene limestones stretch southwards for several hundred
kilometres. In Egypt the Lower Eocene consists of a great mass of
nummulitic limestones, some 400-500 metres thick, with no
intercalated clays or sandstones except at the base, and was
evidently formed in water of considerable depth. The thickness of,
and superficial area covered by, these<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_66">[66]</span> limestones show that they were formed in a
truly open sea, in contra-distinction to a littoral area; the
nummulitic sea in fact covered an enormous part of Europe, North
Africa and Asia. To the south of this sea lay the African
continent, a land-mass dating possibly from Palæozoic times. Since,
and possibly partly during, the deposition of the Lower and Middle
Eocene formations, a gradual elevation of the land or lowering of
the sea, resulting in a retreat of the latter, took place; this
continually brought the shore-line further northwards until, during
the deposition of the beds of the Qasr el Sagha series of the
Middle Eocene, we may surmise that it was not very far to the
south, though the exact distance is extremely doubtful; while in
Upper Eocene times it was still further north. We may assume
therefore that the Upper Eocene bone-bearing strata of the Fayûm
represent sediments transported by rivers and currents from a
fairly adjacent continental land-mass to the south and laid down as
littoral and delta deposits beyond the margin of the land. That at
least one large river emerged from the land in the neighbourhood of
the Fayûm is certain; drainage was then, as now, from south to
north, although not probably confined to a single channel like the
present Nile.</p>

<p>Apart from broader considerations a minute examination of the
more typically fluviatile beds favours the conclusion that the
currents were from the south or south-west. The general dip of the
strata, probably the natural inclination of the sediments at the
time of deposit, is from south to north; the most frequent
lamination in the current-bedded arenaceous deposits is also from
south to north. In our excavations for fossil bones it was noted
that of seven tortoise shells exposed at the same time in different
parts of the pit, six lay with their long axes similarly orientated
and were distinctly tilted to the north-east, or exactly away from
the point of the compass from which, as will presently be shown,
the main river probably came. As a rule, however, the scattered
fossil bones and trees in these beds give no definite clue as to
the direction from which they were floated. The existence of
separate accumulations of fluviatile sand at different horizons,
but lying one above the other in the series and along a north and
south line, is of importance as indicating the continued appearance
of a river current from the same quarter.</p>

<p>Blanckenhorn has published<a id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> diagrams showing what he
supposes to have been the relative areas occupied by land and sea
in Upper Mokattam, Lower Oligocene, Middle Pliocene and Pleistocene
times. Various lines of drainage are shown, the main river, which
he calls the Ur-Nil, being placed some 70 kilometres to the west of
the modern Nile, although closely following the trend of the
latter. We have been unable to ascertain on what evidence
Blanckenhorn relies for assuming rivers in Upper Mokattam and Lower
Oligocene times to have occupied the positions shown on his
diagrams; the number and positions of such rivers must remain more
or less problematical. In this connection however it is interesting
to recall<a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class=
"fnanchor">[82]</a> the lacustrine ferruginous grits which were
brought to notice by the writer in 1900<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_67">[67]</span> as having been deposited in a lake, occupying
in post-Middle Eocene times a shallow depression in that part of
the Libyan desert now occupied by the oasis-depression of Baharia.
Similar deposits were found forming the hills of Gar el Hamra a few
kilometres east of the extreme north end of the depression.
Finally, during a traverse through the unexplored country
south-west of Gar el Gehannem in the winter of 1902-1903, hills
capped with dark hard ferruginous silicified grits and puddingstone
were met with in the extreme south-west of the Fayûm depression at
a point nearly midway, and in the direct line, between the hills of
Gar el Hamra and the chief bone-bearing localities in the north of
the Fayûm. The deposits in question—at Baharia, at Gar el Hamra and
in the hills to the south-west of the Fayûm—are evidently of
lacustrine and fluviatile origin; and we may infer, with some
degree of probability, that they were laid down along the course of
a river which flowed in a north-easterly direction and formed
extensive delta deposits in what is now the northern part of the
Fayûm. That this river had its origin in the interior of a
well-wooded continent hundreds of miles to the south of Baharia is
not to be questioned; its size, length and exact position must
remain matters of doubt, but of its existence we can be as certain
as if in times of flood we had stood on its banks and watched the
passage northwards of its turbid swollen waters, laden with matted
rafts of forest trees and bearing seawards the carcases of those
curious Eocene animals, the remains of which are so abundant in the
Fayûm of to-day.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Middle and Upper Eocene beds we first obtain an idea of
the animals which inhabited Africa in Tertiary times, and the
collecting and working out of this fauna will<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_68">[68]</span> throw much light, not only on our actual
knowledge of the African vertebrata of the Eocene period, which was
practically nil until the discovery of the remains here described,
but also on other wider biological questions, such as the origin of
certain groups of animals, some of which were evolved in this part
of the world.</p>

<p>As recently pointed out by a writer in the Field (No. 2605, Nov.
29, 1902) many years ago the late Prof. Huxley, to account for the
present distribution of the mammalian fauna of Africa and
Magadascar, advanced the theory that in the early part of the
Tertiary period Madagascar was connected with Africa, and Africa
with Europe or Asia, a connection which allowed of the immigration
into Africa and Madagascar of numerous small types of European and
Asian mammals. Madagascar later becoming separated from the
mainland, its fauna, undisturbed by the larger carnivora, was able
to develop to its present remarkable extent. Subsequently to the
isolation of Madagascar the ancestors of the modern fauna were
presumed to have invaded the African continent from the north.</p>

<p>The extinct fauna of the Fayûm, however, shows that in early
Tertiary times Africa already had its own mammalian fauna, which,
besides containing some remarkable large types of somewhat doubtful
position, such as <i>Arsinoitherium</i>, <i>Barytherium</i>, etc.,
certainly in <i>Mœritherium</i> and <i>Palæomastodon</i> included
the earliest known elephants, the forbears of the Mastodon and the
modern elephants. There is little doubt therefore that in Upper
Eocene and Oligocene times these early members of the elephant
group ranged northward and eastwards into Asia and India, and since
in the Upper Tertiary deposits of India and eastern Asia the
extinct transitional types between the mastodons and modern
elephants appear to have been found, it is not unlikely that during
the later phases of the evolution of this group of animals the
radiation was back towards Africa, so that the African elephant may
be, as it has usually been regarded, an immigrant from the Oriental
region. Further research among the later deposits of the Fayûm and
the deserts to the north may, however, throw an entirely new light
on the subject and it is somewhat premature to theorise at
present.</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to notice the observation
of so eminent a palæontologist as Prof. H. F. Osborn. In two recent
addresses<a id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class=
"fnanchor">[83]</a> to the New York Academy of Sciences he
pertinently points out his belief that the African continent has
been a great centre of radiation of certain groups of the mammalia,
and especially mentions the Proboscidea as likely to have been
evolved in the Ethiopian region. Our discoveries in the Fayûm and
Andrews’s determinations, made subsequently to these addresses, so
completely confirm this view, at any rate with regard to the
elephants, that it may not be out of place to give here a somewhat
lengthy extract of his “<em>Theory of Successive Invasions of an
African Fauna into Europe</em>” (op. cit. pp. 56-58). “In Europe
there are in the Upper Eocene two classes of animals, first those
which have their ancestors in the older rocks; second, the class
including certain highly specialized animals which have no
ancestors in the older rocks, among these, perhaps, are the
peculiar flying rodents or <i>Anomaluridæ</i>, now confined to
Africa, and secondly the highly specialized even-toed ruminant
types the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
anoplotheres, xiphodonts and others, the discovery of which in the
gypse near Paris Cuvier has made famous. It is tempting to imagine
that these animals did not evolve in Europe but that they represent
what may be called the first invasion of Europe by African types
from the Ethiopian region.</p>

<p>“It is a curious fact that the African continent as a great
theater of adaptive radiation of Mammalia has not been sufficiently
considered. It is true that it is the dark continent of
palæontology for it has no fossil mammal history; but it by no
means follows that the Mammalia did not enjoy there an extensive
evolution.<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class=
"fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>“Although it is quite probable that this idea has been advanced
before, most writers speak mainly or exclusively of <em>the
invasion of Africa by European types</em>. Blanford and Allen, it
is true, have especially dwelt upon the likeness of the Oriental
and Ethiopian fauna, but not in connection with its antecedent
cause. This cause I believe to have been mainly an invasion from
south to north, correlated with the northern extension of Ethiopian
climate and flora during the Middle Tertiary. It is in a less
measure due to a migration from north to south. Let us therefore
clearly set forth the hypothesis of <em>the Ethiopian region or
South Africa as a great center of independent evolution</em> and as
the source of successive northward migrations of animals, some of
which ultimately reached even the extremity of South America, I
refer to the Mastodons. This hypothesis is clearly implied if not
stated by Blanford in 1876 in his paper upon the African element in
the fauna of India.</p>

<p>“The first of these migrations we may suppose brought in certain
highly specialized ruminants of the Upper Eocene, the anomalures or
peculiar flying rodents of Africa; with this invasion may have come
the pangolins and ard varks, and possibly certain armadillos,
<i>Dasypodidæ</i>, if M. Filhol’s identification of
<i>Necrodasypus</i> is correct. A second invasion of great
distinctness may be that which marks the beginning of the Miocene
when the mastodons and dinotheres first appear in Europe, also the
earliest of the antelopes. A third invasion may be represented in
the base of the Pliocene by the increasing number of antelopes, the
great giraffes of the Ægean plateau and in the upper Pliocene by
the hippopotami. With these forms came the rhinoceroses with no
incisor or cutting teeth, similar to the smaller African
rhinoceros, <i>R. bicornis</i>. Another recently discovered African
immigrant upon the Island of Samos in the Ægean plateau is
<i>Pliohyrax</i> or <i>Leptodon</i>, a very large member of the
Hyracoidea, probably aquatic in its habits, indicating that this
order enjoyed an extensive adaptive radiation in Tertiary
times.</p>

<p>“It thus appears that the Proboscidea, Hyracoidea, certain
edentata, the antelopes, the giraffes, the hippopotami, the most
specialized ruminants, and among the rodents, the anomalures,
dormice and jerboas, among monkeys the baboons, may all have
enjoyed their original adaptative radiation in Africa; that they
survived after the glacial period, only in the Oriental or
Indo-Malayan region, and that this accounts for the marked
community of fauna between this region and the Ethiopian as
observed by Blanford and Allen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Against the
prevalent theory of Oriental origin of these animals are: first,
the fact observed by Blanford and Lydekker in the Bugti Beds (Sind)
that the Oligocene or lower Miocene fauna of the Orient is markedly
European in type; second, that if these animals had originated in
Asia some of them would have found their way to North America;
third, the fact that all these animals appear suddenly and without
any known ancestors in older geological formations. These are the
main facts in favor of the Ethiopian migration hypothesis.”</p>

<p>That Professor Osborn’s main contention has already been partly
proved by the Fayûm mammal discoveries is apparent, and how far his
detailed remarks are confirmed will be seen when the new fauna has
been more completely explored and examined.</p>

deposits in the Fayûm.</span></h4>

<p>No traces of deposits of this age having been met so far south
as the Fayûm we may presume that in Miocene times the area had
become land, the sea margin having receded northwards. The slight
depression of Mogara, some 100 kilometres further north-west, is
however cut out in Lower Miocene beds, lithologically somewhat
similar to the Upper Eocene and Oligocene deposits of the Fayûm.
Probably similar conditions obtained throughout, and the existence
of vertebrate remains indicates the persistence of river-currents
from the south. The fauna of the Mogara beds has only as yet been
very incompletely examined, the locality being rather
inaccessible.<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class=

<p>We have presumed that in Miocene times the Fayûm remained land,
no traces of deposits of that age having been recorded; possibly
the area underwent considerable denudation during the Miocene and
early Pliocene periods, but of this it is difficult to adduce
definite evidence. The records of Pliocene times in the Fayûm may
be classed as follows:—</p>

<h4><a id="s12j"></a><em>J.</em>—<span class="bold">Marine
Deposits: Middle Pliocene.</span></h4>

<p>In Middle Pliocene times the area, which had probably undergone
considerable denudation, was again invaded by the sea, and we find
at Sidmant el Jebel, on the south-east side, definite evidence of
deposits of this age in the shape of sands containing such well
known forms as <i>Ostrea cucullata</i> and <i>Pecten
benedictus</i>.</p>

<p>The beds in question reach an altitude of from 60 to 70 metres
and were first brought to notice by Schweinfurth. Although they are
in reality on the Nile Valley side of the separating ridge or
saddle, there is little doubt that the same beds will, when looked
for, be found within the Fayûm depression in places where they have
been preserved. As has already been mentioned this south-eastern
side of the Fayûm yet remains to be examined and mapped in detail,
and the determination of the relation of these marine sands to the
gravel terraces shortly to be described is a matter of primary
importance for the proper interpretation of their relative
ages.</p>

<h4><a id="s12k"></a><em>K.</em>—<span class="bold">Borings on Rock
surfaces; of doubtful age.</span></h4>

<p>There are within the Fayûm depression numerous rock-surfaces
pierced by borings, apparently the work of marine boring mollusca
but naturally offering no exact evidence as<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_72">[72]</span> to their age and origin. These borings are
found at two distinct levels, approximately from zero to 20 metres
above sea-level, and at 112 metres above sea-level.</p>

<h5>(α) <em>Low level borings.</em></h5>

<p>Between Tamia and Dimê, near the eastern end of the Birket el
Qurûn, the lowest ground, consisting of poor sandy land with
tamarisk scrub, bordering the lake and cultivation, is bounded by a
low escarpment of beds of the Birket el Qurûn series. Along certain
horizons one or more beds of calcareous sandstone weather into
large globular masses, which as already pointed out are in reality
huge concretions, but which may have been further rounded by
water-action. The chief point is, however, the fact that these
blocks are honey-combed in the most remarkable way by beautiful
examples of borings; their presence was first noticed by
Schweinfurth. The globular masses of sandstone, often several feet
in diameter, are worn on the surface into a number of parallel
ledges, each of which is perforated with countless numbers of
vertical holes, averaging 10 millimetres in diameter (maximum 15
millimetres), placed at right angles to the ledges; these holes are
not, as a rule, connected from one ledge to another. They occur in
every stage of perfection, from hollows as small as the finger tips
and only a few millimetres deep, to long completed chambers which
generally show considerable tapering, and are often placed so close
together that the dividing wall is pierced.</p>

<p>Fig. 7 and <a href="#i13">Plate XIII</a> show the appearance of
these bored rocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw4">

<p class="cp2"><span class="sc">Fig</span>. 7.—Block of sandstone
pierced by numerous borings.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>At El Kenîsa, a promontory jutting out into the lake, sandstones
showing shell-borings occur at a height of 14 metres above
sea-level. Between Dimê and the lake a calcareous sandstone
contains many borings, 66 metres above the lake-level, or about 22
metres above sea-level.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw1">
<figure id="i13">

<a href="images/i13.jpg"><img src='images/i13.jpg' alt=''></a>
<p class="cp1">BORINGS IN FALSE-BEDDED SANDSTONE, TWO KILOMETRES
SOUTH OF DIMÊ.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<h5><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>(β) <em>High
level borings.</em></h5>

<p>Further west, but at a considerably higher level, borings are
again met with. In this case a hard compact limestone, forming a
dip-slope surface on the top of the lower cliff of the Qasr el
Sagha series, was found pierced with borings, similar in character
to those of the lower level. The exact locality where these high
level borings were observed is 14 kilometres west of the western
end of the lake and 16 kilometres north-east of the eastern
extremity of Gar el Gehannem. The height was determined as 156
metres above the Birket el Qurûn, or 112 metres above sea-level,
and we have every reason to believe these figures to be
approximately correct. Up to the present time borings at this
altitude have not been met with in any other locality.</p>

<p>At first sight it seems surprising that the occurrences should
be so limited, but it should be remembered that only in those cases
where borings were made in the very hardest and most durable rocks
could they have been preserved to the present time. Considering the
amount of denudation which has taken place in the area since the
Pliocene period it is surprising that any of the rocks which formed
the actual surface of the country at that date should still be
preserved; and in all probability the comparatively few records
that exist to-day owe their preservation to the protection afforded
by superficial deposits. Under the present rigorous desert
conditions, when the whole surface is subjected to continual and
rapid changes of temperature, and every exposed rock is being worn
down by the natural sandblast, it must be admitted that in a
comparatively short time every trace of the borings now exposed
will have been removed. At the same time the denudation of
superficial deposits will probably lay bare other bored
rock-surfaces, and the conserving nature of drift sand itself where
accumulated to even a limited degree must not be forgotten.</p>

<h4><a id="s12l"></a><em>L.</em>—<span class="bold">Gravel
Terraces: ? Upper Pliocene.</span></h4>

<p>On the north, east, and south-east sides of the Fayûm, well
marked terraces of gravel are found at certain levels up to a
maximum of about 170-180 metres above sea-level. Nine kilometres
east of Sêla the summit of the ridge separating the Fayûm and the
Nile Valley is formed of thick deposits of gravel, laid irregularly
and unconformably on the top of limestones belonging to the Birket
el Qurûn series. The lowest terrace occurs only 15 metres above the
canal<a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class=
"fnanchor">[86]</a> running along the outside of the cultivation.
The main deposit of gravel is laid on the top of the limestones and
marls at 70 metres above the canal; it is some 50 metres thick
(summit 120 metres above canal) and consists of a mass of
well-rolled flint and quartz pebbles, with blocks of limestone
(frequently full of well-known Eocene fossils such as <i>Carolia
placunoides</i>). Large well rounded blocks of grey quartzite and
pebbles of black quartzite also occur, besides rounded blocks of
silicified wood. A certain amount of false-bedding occurs and
false-bedded sand was noticed in places. Numerous derived rolled
fossils are present, but no contemporaneous remains<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> were found. On the summit of the
ridge is situated the remnant of an old pyramid-like building.</p>

<p>Fig. 8 shows the relation of these gravels to the underlying
rocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw2">

etc.; (<em>d</em>) sands and sandrock with leaves of hard
sandstone; (<em>e</em>) sand, gravel and conglomerate.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>At the spur of the cliff immediately to the east the terrace is
laid on to limestones of the Birket el Qurûn series at a height of
32 metres above the canal. Enormous blocks of
<i>Carolia</i>-limestone, some exceeding 3 × 2 × 1·5 metres in
measurement, are included in this deposit; such blocks cannot have
been transported far, and were doubtless derived from
formerly-existing higher beds in the immediate neighbourhood. The
matrix of the deposit is usually crushed limestone with sand and
gravel. Occasional fragments of silicified wood (and further west
large logs), evidently derived from the Fluvio-marine beds, also
occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>In favoured
localities the relation of the gravels to the Eocene is still
better seen; the lower beds of the terrace here are sometimes
formed of sands and sandy beds dipping 10° eastward.</p>

<p>At the little promontory 9 kilometres east of Sersena the same
deposits reach an altitude of 157 metres above the canal below.</p>

<p>Further north another cake of gravel caps the summit, attaining
here 60-70 metres above the canal-level. Probably these deposits
were originally more or less connected and continuous, but since
their deposition denudation must have removed the greater part, as
they are now only found here and there capping the highest points
of the escarpment along the east side of the Fayûm. Such isolated
gravel-capped hills occur notably 12 kilometres east of Roda, 16½
kilometres east and 17½ kilometres north-east of Tamia.</p>

<p>Along the north side of the Fayûm the same deposits are found,
in some cases covering large areas.</p>

<p>Twenty-five kilometres N.N.E. of Tamia the Eocene beds, here an
alternating series of clays and limestones, are capped by a deposit
consisting of coarse rolled gravel, with blocks of silicified wood
enclosed in a sandy gypseous base, some 10 metres thick. A larger
and similar deposit caps the next high ground four kilometres to
the west, and about 9 kilometres N.N.E. of Garat el Faras; in this
case it forms a round-topped gravelly hill-range, attaining a
height of about 165 metres above the canal to the south-east. The
loose gravel at many points passes into hard conglomerate, notably
in the hills 9 kilometres east and 4 kilometres north-east of Garat
el Gindi. At the former spot the conglomerate is composed of blocks
of limestone, with round pebbles of flint and quartz, sandstone and
quartzite, and fragments of silicified wood, cemented by sand and
calcareous material. Blocks of silicified wood also occur strewn on
the surface of these gravel deposits.</p>

<p>In the hills north-east of Garat el Gindi the gravel deposits do
not occupy the summit of the escarpment but occur laid on to a
platform of beds belonging to the Qasr el Sagha series. Behind,
another escarpment, that of the Fluvio-marine series, rises to the
plateau summit.</p>

<p><a href="#fig09">Fig. 9</a> will show the general relation of
the different formations in this part of the district.</p>

<p>Near Elwat Hialla the deposits contain numerous blocks of basalt
in addition to the usual constituents. The basalt is derived from
the sheets interbedded at the base of the Oligocene a little to the
north. As these gravels are here close to that formation, blocks of
sandstone, basalt, and silicified wood now form a large proportion
of the constituents.</p>

<p>Along the north side of the Fayûm depression, to the west of
Elwat Hialla, the gravel terraces are almost absent, having been
removed nearly completely by denudation. That the terraces once
existed throughout this region is however shown by the small
patches met with to the north-east of Widan el Faras, the eastern
extremity of Jebel el Qatrani, and at several points high up on the
escarpments as far west as the western end of the lake. Beyond the
latter point these terrace gravels have not been noticed; the
slopes of the depression<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_76">[76]</span> become more and more obscured by loose
superficial flints washed down from the plateau, and the existence
of underlying terrace gravels could only be shown by detailed
mapping.</p>

<p>Near Widan el Faras the terrace occurs at a level of about 220
metres above the Birket el Qurûn, or 175 metres above sea-level,
and consists of a 10-metre thickness of a semi-consolidated mass of
boulders and pebbles of sandstone, limestone, and basalt, with fine
gravel and sand, unconformably laid on to the variegated sandstones
of the Fluvio-marine series.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the Survey’s main excavations for fossil
bones, to the north of Garat el Esh, several local remnants of the
formerly more or less continuous gravel terrace were detected<a id=
"FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.
The height was probably more accurately determined here than
elsewhere and the upper limit of the deposits was found to lie at
approximately 170 metres above sea-level; this figure may indeed be
taken as the average height of the Pliocene terraces throughout the
Fayûm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Briefly then we
have shown the existence of the well marked remains of a gravel
terrace 170-180 metres above sea-level, throughout the south-east,
east, and north sides of the Fayûm depression, and the first
question that suggests itself with regard to these deposits is,
whether they are of marine or of freshwater origin? From their
position in part capping and in part perched on the flanks of the
escarpments, it is evident that the depression of the Fayûm must
have been partly formed before their deposition; probably it had
approximately obtained to its present form and dimensions, except
as to depth. The terrace certainly marks the shoreline of the sheet
of water in which its constituents were deposited, and the surface
of this water must have attained a height of nearly 200 metres
above present sea-level. It is not unlikely that some of the
extensive plains of the Fayûm may owe their existence in part to
the presence in Pliocene times of the sea or of a large inland
lake, that they may in fact be plains of denudation. The plain
above the escarpment of the Qasr el Sagha series, lying between 150
and 200 metres above sea-level, and stretching throughout a large
part of the north of the Fayûm, has characters which tend to
support this idea.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the gravels are entirely barren of contemporaneous
organic remains, with one exception; near Ez. Qalamsha some
examples of <i>Ostrea cucullata</i> were discovered, and these we
believe to have truly belonged to the lower beds of the terraces
and not to have been derived from the undoubted marine Middle
Pliocene beds of Sidmant. If the existence of <i>O. cucullata</i>
in these terraces could be confirmed we should undoubtedly class
them as marine and of Middle Pliocene age. But the single evidence
of the Qalamsha shells is not sufficient, and confirmatory
occurrences must be obtained and, if possible, the relation of the
terraces to Schweinfurth’s marine Sidmant beds determined, which
has not been yet done.</p>

<p>Of distinctly later date than the gravel-terraces are the widely
distributed gypseous deposits of the Fayûm and Nile Valley. These
deposits are found covering the plain which separates the Nile

the level of the former until they overlie the gravels capping the
summit overlooking the Fayûm (<a href="#i21">Section XXI</a>).</p>

<p>The gravel deposits along the east side of the Fayûm are always
capped by a gypseous bed. The latter is often 2 metres thick and
frequently occurs as solid and almost pure white crystalline
gypsum; sometimes it is calcareous and is frequently deposited in a
tufaceous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> manner,
especially resembling a tufa on the weathered surface. At other
times it passes into a yellowish compact mass and may be very
saliferous.</p>

<p>Frequently the deposit is full of rounded pebbles, the latter
being often in the greater proportion and forming a sort of
gypsum-cemented conglomerate. Not unfrequently it is impossible to
draw any divisional line between the terrace gravels and the
gypseous gravels above. Probably they are both closely connected
and of Upper Pliocene age.</p>

<h4><a id="s12n"></a><em>N.</em>—<span class="bold">Summary of the
Pliocene Period.</span></h4>

<p>From the above descriptions it is probable that the Pliocene
period is represented in the Fayûm by the following:—</p>

<p>(1) Marine beds of Sidmant, undoubtedly of Middle Pliocene age
and reaching a level of from 60 to 70 metres above present
sea-level.</p>

<p>(2) Borings on exposed rock-surfaces at two distinct levels, the
lower 0-20 metres, the higher some 112 metres, above sea-level.
These borings appear to be the work of marine boring mollusca, and
although those on the lower level may perhaps be of Middle Pliocene
age with the Sidmant beds, the similar examples discovered at a
much higher altitude (112 metres), point to the sea having attained
a much higher level in later, perhaps Upper Pliocene, times.</p>

<p>(3) An extensive beach or terrace of gravel on the south-east,
east, and north sides of the Fayûm, attaining a maximum level of
about 170 to 180 metres above sea-level.</p>

<p>All the known facts seem to be satisfied if we imagine that in
the Middle Pliocene the sea occupied the area, depression probably
continuing until the 112 metre level with the highest borings was
reached. Perhaps the lowest part of the terraces was formed during
this time. In the later Pliocene times we may infer that the area
was occupied, up to 180 metres above present sea-level, by a vast
inland lake, perhaps of brackish water, connected with the sea on
the one hand and the fiord or lakes of the Nile Valley on the
other, the deposits of which have been described elsewhere<a id=
"FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class=
"fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<p>Along the margins of this gigantic lake, these great
accumulations of gravel might well have been formed, chiefly of
material derived from the immediate shores, augmented perhaps by a
certain amount of sediment brought by river-currents from the
south.</p>

<p>Finally, from the way in which the gypsum and gypseous deposits
are laid on the terrace gravels, and from their extension and
thickness, we may presume that they were deposited on the bottom of
just such a lake on evaporation of its water, when the sulphate of
lime in solution, becoming more and more concentrated, may have
been finally precipitated.<a id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href=

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span><a id=
"s13"></a><span class="sc">Section</span> XIII.—PLEISTOCENE.</h3>

<p>The course of events in Pleistocene times is at present obscure.
As far as can be judged it was during this period that a freshwater
lake, the precursor of the great Mœris, came into existence. It
might be thought that the early Pleistocene prehistoric lake was a
relic of the still older body of water of Pliocene times, in which
the gravel terraces and gypseous deposits were laid down. But such
a remnant would have been of a high degree of salinity and could
not have given rise to the fresh water Mœris. Most probably at the
close of the Pliocene period, after the formation of the gypseous
deposits, the area became elevated and cut off from the sea and
from the Nile Valley marine fiord; probably an extensive body of
water remained as an isolated lake, but this, cut off from external
supply, would have gradually evaporated, its salt being left as a
superficial deposit on the dried up bed. In early Pleistocene times
we may presume the area became dry and was gradually eroded to its
present shape and depth. The superficial deposits of salt and
gypsum were for the most part removed as the depression was
deepened, while the continuous terrace of gravel laid round the
greater part of the rim was broken through, except where protected
in favourable localities, the constituents being washed down and
spread out over the lower ground. In course of time the region was
moulded to its present form and dimensions, or rather to what it
would be if the local alluvial deposits were stripped off and the
water of the lake baled out. The area was an inland depression,
probably sparsely vegetated like the rest of the higher country and
separated from the Nile Valley by a low rocky ridge surmounted by a
more of less continuous terrace of gravel of considerable height
and thickness. In our opinion desert conditions had already set in
before the early Nile broke down the ridge and formed a lake in the
Fayûm; the date when this important event first took place is a
matter of considerable doubt, as has already been mentioned (pp.
<a href="#Page_24">24,</a> <a href="#Page_25">25</a>). We know that
at the close of the Pliocene period the Nile Valley was a marine
fiord (connected with the Fayûm and the Mediterranean) which was
replaced in Pleistocene times, probably in consequence of slight
elevation, by a series of fresh water lakes throughout the valley.
These lakes were probably two or three in number and drained one
into the other; the exact position of the barriers is as yet a
matter of conjecture. Within these lakes thick lacustrine deposits
were accumulated, so that the basins eventually became to a great
extent silted up. In later Pleistocene times drainage down the Nile
Valley appears to have become more pronounced, the barriers between
the lakes were broken down and the river cut for itself a channel
through the lacustrine beds, filling up the old lake basins. From
this time onwards to early prehistoric times the bed of the river
would appear to have steadily fallen, as it eroded its channel
deeper and deeper. That this early Nile was a river of considerable
size is evident from the amount of erosion it accomplished in the
trough of the valley, whence the older lacustrine beds have been
almost completely removed. Probably in the lower part of its course
it swept against the base of the dividing ridge between the Nile
Valley and the Fayûm depression. If, as we imagine, the river was
at that time flowing some<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_80">[80]</span> 20 metres higher than at present its currents
would have met with little resistance from the loosely cemented
terrace of gravel which formed the upper part of the dividing
ridge. Once this was broken down the waters must have poured into
the depression behind, until a lake of considerable size was
formed. The sediment spread out over the floor in the shape of a
fan, while at the same time deposits of sands and fine clays, blown
and washed into the waters from the surrounding shores, were being
slowly accumulated in the quieter and more remote parts of the
lake.</p>

<p>For some time subsequent to the first connection between the
Fayûm depression and the Nile, the latter continued to fall in
level owing to continued erosion along its course, possibly the
Fayûm again became completely isolated for a time. Subsequently in
the earliest historic times under changed conditions the river
commenced to carry and lay down the modern alluvial deposit of
“Nile mud”, and from this time to the present day its bed has
gradually risen. This is shown by the high Nile flood-readings on
the early gauges of the Nile Valley; the nilometer at Roda shows a
difference of 1·22 metres in 1026 years, or an annual rise of 0·12
centimetre, which is equivalent to 12 metres in 10,000 years<a id=
"FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.
Whether there was ever complete disconnection between the Nile and
the originally formed lake in Pleistocene times is uncertain, but
even so it was probably only during a comparatively short period:
in early historic times the rise of the Nile bed must have brought
about a reconnection.</p>

<p>The geological evidence for the existence of a great freshwater
lake in Pleistocene and prehistoric times is afforded by the
well-marked lacustrine clays and sands which are found over such a
large area of the northern and western deserts of the Fayûm; the
great extent of this lake will be seen by an examination of the
accompanying maps. Its area must have been about 2250 square
kilometres or about ten times the size of the modern Birket el
Qurûn. The western limit may even have been further west than shown
on <a href="#fig10">fig. 10.,</a><a id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> as some of the desert in
the neighbourhood of Gar el Gehannem is very low-lying; or there
may have existed subsidiary lakes in that direction. The upper
limit of these ancient lacustrine clays is between 22 and 23 metres
above sea-level, which exactly agrees with the figure adduced by
Sir Hanbury Brown as the height of the more modern Lake Moeris from
the evidence of levels. That Lake Moeris was simply the older
prehistoric lake placed under artificial control admits of no
doubt; the difficult question being as to when the lake first came
into existence in prehistoric times.</p>

<p>The clays abound in freshwater shells and semi-fossil fish-bones
of exactly the same species of fish (siluroid, etc) as still
inhabit the Birket el Qurûn; probably some are even hardly
different specifically from the Middle Eocene forms of the
district. In addition remains of large animals are common, and
include <i>Hippopotamus</i>, <i>Elephas</i>, <i>Bubalis</i>, sheep
or goat, and <i>Canis</i>, with crocodiles and turtles, etc.<a id=

</ul>

<p>Blanckenhorn has pointed out<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> that this fauna is of
special interest and differs from all fossil and living faunas in
Egypt. It might be compared with the <i>Melanopsis</i>-fauna of the
Nile Valley if the exceptional <i>Limnaea</i> were replaced by
<i>Melanopsis</i> or <i>Paludina</i>. Its <i>Unio Schweinfurthi</i>
recalls the youngest alluvial deposits of the Nile Valley, 2nd
Cataract, Kom Ombo and Silsila; at these places, however, the beds
containing the species in question are at least 20 metres above
mean water level of the present day.</p>

<p>The sub-fossil fauna of the Fayûm alluvium, in addition to those
forms everywhere met with in the Nile Valley, includes <i>Neritina
nilotica</i> and <i>Melania tuberculata</i>, which are common forms
of the <i>Melanopsis</i> stage, as well as <i>Unio abyssinicus</i>
and <i>Valvata nilotica</i>. In common with the present fauna of
the Birket el Qurûn it has the five forms belonging to the genera
<i>Corbicula</i>, <i>Neritina</i>, <i>Valvata</i>, <i>Melania</i>,
and <i>Planorbis</i>. The sub-fossil fauna, which passes into the
modern fauna of the Birket el Qurûn, shows connection with the
Mediterranean and Blue Nile, but has a total absence of White Nile
forms such as <i>Ampullaria</i>, <i>Lanistes</i>, <i>Cleopatra
bulimoides</i>, <i>Spatha</i> and <i>Aetheria</i>. Moreover
<i>Limnæa palustris</i>, although identical with the form found on
other Mediterranean coasts, is as yet entirely unknown from the
Nile Valley. Blanckenhorn concludes that the diluvial subfossil
deposits of the Fayûm were produced when the climate of Egypt was
damper and more Europæan, the Nile carrying more arenaceous
sediment in place of the mud of to-day and running at higher level,
as it did when the shells of <i>Unio Schweinfurthi</i> were
enclosed in the deposits of Jebel Silsila. Blanckenhorn thinks the
Nile obtained access to the depression during the last European ice
period. This last supposition, coupled with the above comparison of
the Fayûm fresh-water fauna with the Melanopsis stage of the Nile
Valley Pleistocene series, shows that in regarding the early Fayûm
lake as dating from prehistoric times Blanckenhorn and the writer
are in agreement.</p>

<h3><a id="s14"></a><span class="sc">Section</span>
XIV.—RECENT.</h3>

<p>We may divide the Recent period into two epochs, Prehistoric and
Historic, always remembering that the line of demarcation is not
much more distinct than that between Recent and Pleistocene.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span><a id=
"s14o"></a><em>O.</em>—<span class="bold">Prehistoric.</span></h4>

<p>The abundance of worked flints on the desert just within and
around the site occupied by the Fayûm lake in late Pleistocene and
prehistoric times, shows that the shores were eventually inhabited
by people who made and used these primitive tools. That the edge of
the lake was abundantly wooded is shown by the thousands of well
preserved tamarisk stumps met with at the present day in situ
(<a href="#i14">Plate XIV</a>) in the clays throughout the former
margin of the lake.</p>

<p>The implements occur chiefly along the margin of the highest
level of the old lake, and have probably in many cases been buried
in the lake clays until the present time, which would account for
their beautiful state of preservation. We have not, however, yet
actually detected them enclosed within the clays, although commonly
found lying on the clean wind-worn surface. From the fine degree of
workmanship we may undoubtedly refer these flint implements to the
Neolithic or later stone-age, although the exact date is doubtful.
That they were made and used while the lake still stood at its
highest level seems certain, but as we have shown above, the lake,
as a sheet of water up to 23 metres above sea-level or thereabouts,
probably existed far anterior to the Egyptian historic period. They
might, on the other hand, as far as the evidence from the position
of the lake goes, have been used by the inhabitants of the
lake-margin down to the great reclamation which took place in
Ptolemaic times. As it seems impossible to date them by comparison
with flints of known age from any Egyptian period, we may perhaps
conclude that they are at least of older date than the earliest
Egyptian records.<a id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<h4><a id="s14p"></a><em>P.</em>—<span class=
"bold">Historic.</span></h4>

<p>In historical times, under conditions almost identical with
those of the Nile of to-day, there would have been an annual inflow
during the flood and outflow back to the Nile when the latter
subsided; during the inflow a constant supply of Nile mud was
brought into the lake and deposited on the surface of the earlier
alluvium, continually augmenting the thickness of the latter and
raising its surface, until in the central area marshy land began to
appear. In the XII Dynasty this natural backwater of the Nile,
which acted as a more or less efficient regulator of high and low
floods, was brought under human control by Amenemhat I, and a
considerable area of land reclaimed from the shallowest part of the
lake, or that part of the country now lying near Edwa, Medinet el
Fayûm, etc. The new artificially controlled lake was called Moeris,
and its wonders are mentioned by Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus,
Strabo and Pliny.</p>

<p>The actual position of Lake Moeris has been the subject of much
discussion, the late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Linant de Bellefonds<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96"
class="fnanchor">[96]</a> having asserted that it was a high-level
lake, quite distinct from the Birket el Qurûn, occupying the gap in
the hills by which the Bahr Yusef enters the Fayûm, its encircling
bank commencing at Edwa and passing through Biahmu, Medinet, etc.
Sir Hanbury Brown has,<a id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> however, completely
demolished Linant’s theory, which is shown to be absolutely
untenable; and has proved conclusively that the ancient Mœris
occupied the greater part of what is now the cultivated land, as
well as the area covered by the present lake and a considerable
part of the surrounding desert, the reclaimed land being in fact
part of the very district Linant supposed the lake to have
occupied. Since the publication of Brown’s work complete
corroborative evidence has been forthcoming from two distinct
sources, one archæological, the other geological. The latter has
already been mentioned.</p>

<p class="cp2"><span class="sc">Fig</span>. 10.—Sketch Map showing
approximately the site of Lake Moeris.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>It was clear from the map of Claudius Ptolemy that the route
through the Fayûm to the Oasis Parva left Bacchias near the north
end of the lake, and passing between Arsinœ and Lake Mœris, reached
Dionysias near the other end. The archæological researches of
Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt<a id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> have shown that Bacchias
occupied the site of the modern Um<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_84">[84]</span> el Atl close to one end of the Birket el
Qurûn, while Dionysias was probably in the neighbourhood of Qasr el
Banat or Qasr el Qurûn. Thus the Ptolemaic Lake Mœris was almost
identical with the modern Birket el Qurûn. Neither did the sites
excavated yield a trace of anything older than the third century
B.C. Theadelphia and Philoteris were founded in the reign of the
second Ptolemy, when a great reclamation of the land from the lake
took place, and probably Euhemeria, Dionysias, Karanis and Bacchias
date from the same reign.</p>

<p>The archæological evidence is thus briefly summed up by Grenfell
and Hunt: “Originally the lake filled the whole basin of the Fayûm,
the first reclamation being carried out by Amenemhat I, who built
the great dam at El Lahûn, where the Bahr Yusef enters the
province, and recovered the high ground near the entrance as far as
Biahmu, and a point between Abshawai and Agamiin. This remained the
Pharaonic province until the time of Herodotus, when the water
still came up to the colossi at Biahmu. Subsequently all the land
now cultivated below the level of the Pharaonic province was
reclaimed, chiefly in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, when Lake
Mœris was reduced nearly to the size of its modern representative,
the Birket el Qurûn”.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Present day Fauna

fauna of the Fayûm differs in one or two particulars from the fauna

<i>Hydrobia stagnalis</i>, as a typical brackish water form is of
special interest. The species appears to have established itself in
the Birket el Qurûn in modern times, as it has not been found in
the youngest alluvium of the lake, nor is it known in the modern
Nile fauna.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><span class="sidenote">Modern Deposits:
Blown Sand and Erosion.</span>Except for the gradual accumulation
of silt over the bed of the Birket el Qurûn—sand and clay carried
in by the wind and the fine sediment borne by the feeder canals—the
only modern deposits of any importance are those of blown sand. The
extensive arenaceous deposits of younger Tertiary age, forming the
greater part of the continent from the latitude of the Fayûm to the
Mediterranean shores, yield as a result of the action of denudation
a constant and abundant supply of the raw material. The sand
carried southwards by the prevailing winds accumulates as dunes in
the lowest parts of the depressions, on the slopes of cliffs, and
in all the less exposed localities. Wind swept areas remain free or
are only gradually encroached on by slowly growing linear dunes
originating in the wind-shadow of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_85">[85]</span> some protecting hill or ridge. An unique
example of such a dune is to be seen at the south end of the
well-marked ridge a few kilometres east of Gar el Gehannem
(<a href="#i15">Plate XV</a>).</p>

<p>The main accumulations of blown sand are in the southern part of
the Fayûm; large areas of the floors of Wadis Rayan and Moêla are
covered with dunes, while in their immediate neighbourhood the
material has accumulated to such an extent as to blot out entire
cliffs and valleys; immediately to the west of Gharaq a
considerable area is covered with small but steep dunes; and
finally must be mentioned the great linear belt of sand, known as
the Ghart el Khanashat, which starting from a point about midway
between the Wadi Natrûn and Mogara comes to an abrupt termination
some 24 kilometres before gaining the northern escarpment of the
Fayûm depression (see <a href="#Page_23">page 23</a>).</p>

<p>As might be expected in an area like the Fayûm, where
sedimentary rocks of every type are met with, and where the wind
never wants for a sufficient supply of the necessary sand,
superficial erosion is everywhere well marked. We do not propose to
study here the action of wind-borne sand and it will be sufficient
to mention two localities where the effects are best seen; one is
in the neighbourhood of Garat el Esh, where the most remarkable
scoring and grooving is to be seen on the two beds of limestone
capping the upper and lower cliffs of the Middle Eocene; the other
is the Zeuglodon Valley, and here the sculpturing of the sandstone
of the Birket el Qurûn series is of the finest and most unique
description.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62"><span class=

occur chiefly in the sandy and clayey beds. Skeletons of marine
animals such as <i>Zeuglodon</i> and <i>Eosiren</i> may, however,
be frequently observed embedded in the hard intercalated
limestones. Limestone cranial-casts of these animals are thus
sometimes found, and one of these has already been figured and
described (Elliot Smith, <em>The Brain of the Archæoceti</em>,
Proceedings Royal Society, Vol. 71, pp. 322-331. Some most
beautifully formed casts from one of the limestone beds were
eventually determined by Andrews to be casts of the air passages of
crocodile skulls.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64"><span class=

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65"><span class=
"label">[65]</span></a>Mayer-Eymar appears to believe the
depression of the Fayûm is the result of the volcanic activity
which produced these basalt flows. He says (op. cit. <em>Nouvelles
recherches, etc.</em>, p. 218.) “Or, de cette extension
extraordinaire du phénomène volcanique dans l’ouest du grand
désert, il est, en premier lieu, permis de conclure que c’est par
suite de son action excavante qu’a eu lieu l’effondrement rempli de
nos jours, en partie par le lac de Fayum.”</p>

<p>Personally, we cannot see the slightest evidence in support of
this. Where the basalt occurs as a hard band it usually causes
steep cliffs as at Widan el Faras, owing to its protecting the
underlying beds from denudation. To the west, in Jebel el Qatrani,
its thickness and hardness determine the character and steepness of
the escarpment below.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66"><span class=
"label">[66]</span></a>Pebble bands are occasionally met with in
the coarser sandstones of the Fluvio-marine series, and it would
seem that from them are derived the pebbles of quartz and flint
which so invariably strew the desert-surface to the north to beyond
the latitude of Cairo. Those flints on the surface are largely
broken up and flaked by changes of temperature, but show
comparatively little shaping by blown sand; the white quartz
pebbles on the other hand, while seldom or never broken or flaked,
are invariably more or less facetted, frequently into typical
“dreikanter” or pyramid-pebbles; below the surface both varieties
are perfectly water-rounded.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67"><span class=

profile were only discovered after long search, and had to be

therefore is only approximate, as individual beds could not always
be correlated at the different points where fossils were
collected.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68"><span class=

that remains of all these vertebrates were found at the point where
the actual line of section runs. As a matter of fact at that
particular point only <i>Palæomastodon</i> remains were observed,
while most of the others were obtained some distance further west.
Remains of <i>Mœritherium</i>, probably identical with <i>M.

beautifully-preserved and almost complete skull, associated with

<em>Ligurien inférieur</em> and <em>Ligurien supérieur</em> is
hardly convincing, especially as no fossils were found by that
observer. The correlation of strata in widely separate areas by
their lithological similarity is at least open to question,
especially with beds of this type, which can indeed be exactly
matched again and again at many levels in the same vertical
succession. His diagnosis of the beds immediately below the basalt
as <em>Tongrien inférieur</em>, rests, however, on firmer grounds,
as this basalt sheet can be traced across the desert to beyond the

same age.</p>
